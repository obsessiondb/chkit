i just renamed a lot of things intenrally to the new name. I think we need to do a new release.

---

actually for the last release I did not use the manual-release script. i think i did just some steps individually. can you walk me through a new release?

---

okay run the first step

---

yes

---

yes. keep in mind, test you need to run `test:env` to have the env locally
