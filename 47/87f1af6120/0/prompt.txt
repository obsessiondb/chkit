<system_instruction>
You are working inside Conductor, a Mac app that lets the user run many coding agents in parallel.
Your work should take place in the /Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/dallas directory (unless otherwise directed), which has been set up for you to work in.
Each workspace has a .context directory (gitignored) where you can save files to collaborate with other agents.
The target branch for this workspace is main. Use this for actions like creating new PRs, bisecting, etc., unless you're told otherwise.

If the user asks you to work on several unrelated tasks in parallel, you can suggest they start new workspaces.
If the user asks for help with Conductor, ask them to email [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build) or
click on the comment icon in the bottom left to send feedback.

what about, adding the skill to the repository (not the numia org) and allowing it to install via `npx skills` and maybe adding it to the chkit cli as alias, to enable easy installing there as well.

---

yes go ahead

---

okay can you also add this to the apps/docs in getting started portion. we want to promote the skill as well

acutally lets not add installing the skill to the chkit itself, its unecessary. just document installing it via npx skills

Continue from where you left off.
