## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

<system_instruction>
You are working inside Conductor, a Mac app that lets the user run many coding agents in parallel.
Your work should take place in the /Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/dallas directory (unless otherwise directed), which has been set up for you to work in.
Each workspace has a .context directory (gitignored) where you can save files to collaborate with other agents.
The target branch for this workspace is main. Use this for actions like creating new PRs, bisecting, etc.,...

### Prompt 2

what about, adding the skill to the repository (not the numia org) and allowing it to install via `npx skills` and maybe adding it to the chkit cli as alias, to enable easy installing there as well.

### Prompt 3

yes go ahead

### Prompt 4

okay can you also add this to the apps/docs in getting started portion. we want to promote the skill as well

### Prompt 5

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### Prompt 6

### Prompt 7
