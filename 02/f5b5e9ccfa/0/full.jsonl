How the system knows which migrations have been applied -- where state is stored\n\nMigration state is tracked via **two local JSON files** inside the `metaDir` directory (defaults to `./chkit/meta/`):\n\n### journal.json -- the migration journal\n\n**File:** `<metaDir>/journal.json`\n**Defined in:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts`\n\nThis is the primary source of truth for which migrations have been applied. Its schema:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MigrationJournal {\n  version: 1\n  applied: MigrationJournalEntry[]\n}\n\ninterface MigrationJournalEntry {\n  name: string       // filename, e.g. \"20260101000000_init.sql\"\n  appliedAt: string   // ISO 8601 timestamp of when it was applied\n  checksum: string    // SHA-256 hex digest of the migration SQL content\n}\n```\n\nExample `journal.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"applied\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"20260101000000_init.sql\",\n      \"appliedAt\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"checksum\": \"a1b2c3d4...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nKey implementation details (from `migration-store.ts` lines 55-92):\n- If `journal.json` does not exist, the system treats it as an empty journal (`{ version: 1, applied: [] }`).\n- The reader handles **legacy formats**: if `applied` entries are plain strings (not objects), they are normalized into `MigrationJournalEntry` with empty `appliedAt` and `checksum`.\n- Writing is done atomically after each individual migration is applied (not batched).\n\n### snapshot.json -- the schema snapshot\n\n**File:** `<metaDir>/snapshot.json`\n**Defined in:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/core/src/snapshot.ts` (creation) and `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` (reading, lines 35-49)\n\nThis file represents the \"last known desired schema state\" and is updated each time `generate` runs:\n\n```typescript\ninterface Snapshot {\n  version: 1\n  generatedAt: string               // ISO timestamp\n  definitions: SchemaDefinition[]    // canonical list of tables/views/materialized_views\n}\n```\n\nThe snapshot is **not** used to track which migrations have been applied. It is used by:\n- `generate` -- to diff the current schema definitions against the previous snapshot and produce migration operations.\n- `drift` -- to compare the expected schema (from snapshot) against the actual live ClickHouse database.\n\n**There is no migration state stored in the ClickHouse database itself.** All state is local, file-based.\n\n### Directory structure defaults\n\nConfigured in `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/core/src/model.ts` (lines 35-38):\n```typescript\nconst outDir = config.outDir ?? './chkit'\nconst migrationsDir = config.migrationsDir ?? join(outDir, 'migrations')\nconst metaDir = config.metaDir ?? join(outDir, 'meta')\n```\n\nSo by default:\n```\n./chkit/\n  migrations/\n    20260101000000_init.sql\n    20260101020000_add_column.sql\n  meta/\n    journal.json\n    snapshot.json\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Migration file format\n\n**Location:** Generated by `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/codegen/src/index.ts` (function `buildMigrationContent`, lines 37-66)\n\n**Filename pattern:** `{timestamp}_{name}.sql` where timestamp is either an auto-generated `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` or a custom `--migration-id`.\n\n**Format (v1):**\n\n```sql\n-- chkit-migration-format: v1\n-- generated-at: 2026-01-02T03:04:05.678Z\n-- cli-version: 0.1.0\n-- definition-count: 1\n-- operation-count: 2\n-- rename-suggestion-count: 0\n-- risk-summary: safe=1, caution=0, danger=0\n-- rename-suggestion: kind=column table=app.users from=email to=user_email confidence=high\n\n-- operation: create_database key=database:app risk=safe\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS app;\n\n-- operation: create_table key=table:app.users risk=safe\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app.users (\n  `id` UInt64\n) ENGINE = MergeTree()\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\nORDER BY (id);\n```\n\nKey structural elements:\n1. **Header comments** (lines starting with `--`): machine-parseable metadata including format version, generation timestamp, CLI version, operation count, risk summary, and rename suggestions.\n2. **Operation comments** (`-- operation: {type} key={key} risk={risk}`): each operation is preceded by a structured comment that the safety marker system can parse.\n3. **SQL statements**: the actual executable DDL.\n\nThe safety markers system (`/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/safety-markers.ts`) parses these structured comments to:\n- Extract executable statements (filtering out comments) via `extractExecutableStatements()`\n- Detect destructive operations (risk=danger) via `migrationContainsDangerOperation()` and `extractDestructiveOperationSummaries()`\n- Extract operation metadata for table scoping via `extractMigrationOperationSummaries()`\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the `migrate` command works\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts`\n\n### What it reads:\n\n1. **Snapshot** (`snapshot.json`) -- used only for table scoping (resolving `--table` selectors).\n2. **Journal** (`journal.json`) -- to determine which migrations have already been applied.\n3. **Migration directory** -- lists all `.sql` files sorted alphabetically.\n4. **Migration SQL files** -- reads content for checksum verification, destructive operation detection, table scoping, and execution.\n\n### Execution flow (lines 99-325):\n\n**Phase 1: Determine pending migrations**\n- Lists all `.sql` files in `migrationsDir`\n- Reads `journal.json` and builds a set of already-applied filenames\n- Filters out applied migrations to get the pending list\n- Runs **checksum verification** on already-applied migrations (compares SHA-256 of current file content against the stored checksum; if mismatch, it errors out with exit code 1)\n\n**Phase 2: Table scoping (optional)**\n- If `--table` is provided, reads each pending migration's operation comments and filters to only those whose operation keys match the selected tables\n\n**Phase 3: Plan vs Execute decision**\n- Without `--apply`/`--execute`: shows the pending list (plan mode) and prompts interactively for confirmation\n- With `--apply`/`--execute`: proceeds to execute\n- In CI/non-TTY: plan-only without `--apply`\n\n**Phase 4: Destructive operation gate**\n- Scans all pending migrations for `risk=danger` operations\n- Without `--allow-destructive`: blocks execution with exit code 3 in JSON mode, or prompts interactively for \"yes\" confirmation\n- With `--allow-destructive` or `safety.allowDestructive=true` in config: proceeds\n\n**Phase 5: Execution**\n- Creates a ClickHouse client from config\n- For each pending migration **in order**:\n  1. Reads the SQL file\n  2. Extracts executable statements (strips comments, splits on `;`)\n  3. Runs plugin hook `runOnBeforeApply()` (plugins can modify statements)\n  4. Executes each statement against ClickHouse via `db.execute()`\n  5. Creates a journal entry with `name`, `appliedAt` (current ISO timestamp), and `checksum` (SHA-256 of file content)\n  6. **Writes journal.json immediately** after each migration (line 300) -- this provides crash recovery: if the process dies mid-batch, previously applied migrations are recorded\n  7. Runs plugin hook `runOnAfterApply()`\n  8. Logs \"Applied: {filename}\"\n\n### What it writes:\n- Updates `journal.json` after each migration is applied (incremental writes, not a single batch)\n- Does NOT update `snapshot.json` (that is only updated by `generate`)\n\n---\n\n## 4. How the `status` command reports migration state\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts`\n\nThis is a read-only command that reports:\n\n1. Lists all `.sql` files in the migrations directory\n2. Reads the journal\n3. Computes pending = files not in journal's applied list\n4. Runs checksum mismatch detection (compares stored checksums against current file hashes)\n\n**Text output:**\n```\nMigrations directory: ./chkit/migrations\nTotal migrations:     3\nApplied:              1\nPending:              2\n\nPending migrations:\n- 20260101020000_add_column.sql\n- 20260101030000_add_index.sql\n\nChecksum mismatches on applied migrations:\n- 20260101000000_init.sql\n```\n\n**JSON output (--json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"status\",\n  \"schemaVersion\": 1,\n  \"migrationsDir\": \"./chkit/migrations\",\n  \"total\": 3,\n  \"applied\": 1,\n  \"pending\": 2,\n  \"pendingMigrations\": [\"20260101020000_add_column.sql\", \"20260101030000_add_index.sql\"],\n  \"checksumMismatchCount\": 1,\n  \"checksumMismatches\": [{\"name\": \"20260101000000_init.sql\", \"expected\": \"abc123\", \"actual\": \"def456\"}]\n}\n```\n\nThe status command does NOT connect to ClickHouse. It is purely a local file system operation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What `drift` and `check` do\n\n### drift command\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/drift.ts`\n**Comparison logic:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/drift.ts`\n\nThe `drift` command compares the **snapshot** (expected schema state) against the **live ClickHouse database** (actual state).

How the system knows which migrations have been applied -- where state is stored\n\nMigration state is tracked via **two local JSON files** inside the `metaDir` directory (defaults to `./chkit/meta/`):\n\n### journal.json -- the migration journal\n\n**File:** `<metaDir>/journal.json`\n**Defined in:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts`\n\nThis is the primary source of truth for which migrations have been applied. Its schema:\n\n```typescript\ninterface MigrationJournal {\n  version: 1\n  applied: MigrationJournalEntry[]\n}\n\ninterface MigrationJournalEntry {\n  name: string       // filename, e.g. \"20260101000000_init.sql\"\n  appliedAt: string   // ISO 8601 timestamp of when it was applied\n  checksum: string    // SHA-256 hex digest of the migration SQL content\n}\n```\n\nExample `journal.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"applied\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"20260101000000_init.sql\",\n      \"appliedAt\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"checksum\": \"a1b2c3d4...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nKey implementation details (from `migration-store.ts` lines 55-92):\n- If `journal.json` does not exist, the system treats it as an empty journal (`{ version: 1, applied: [] }`).\n- The reader handles **legacy formats**: if `applied` entries are plain strings (not objects), they are normalized into `MigrationJournalEntry` with empty `appliedAt` and `checksum`.\n- Writing is done atomically after each individual migration is applied (not batched).\n\n### snapshot.json -- the schema snapshot\n\n**File:** `<metaDir>/snapshot.json`\n**Defined in:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/core/src/snapshot.ts` (creation) and `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` (reading, lines 35-49)\n\nThis file represents the \"last known desired schema state\" and is updated each time `generate` runs:\n\n```typescript\ninterface Snapshot {\n  version: 1\n  generatedAt: string               // ISO timestamp\n  definitions: SchemaDefinition[]    // canonical list of tables/views/materialized_views\n}\n```\n\nThe snapshot is **not** used to track which migrations have been applied. It is used by:\n- `generate` -- to diff the current schema definitions against the previous snapshot and produce migration operations.\n- `drift` -- to compare the expected schema (from snapshot) against the actual live ClickHouse database.\n\n**There is no migration state stored in the ClickHouse database itself.** All state is local, file-based.\n\n### Directory structure defaults\n\nConfigured in `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/core/src/model.ts` (lines 35-38):\n```typescript\nconst outDir = config.outDir ?? './chkit'\nconst migrationsDir = config.migrationsDir ?? join(outDir, 'migrations')\nconst metaDir = config.metaDir ?? join(outDir, 'meta')\n```\n\nSo by default:\n```\n./chkit/\n  migrations/\n    20260101000000_init.sql\n    20260101020000_add_column.sql\n  meta/\n    journal.json\n    snapshot.json\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Migration file format\n\n**Location:** Generated by `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/codegen/src/index.ts` (function `buildMigrationContent`, lines 37-66)\n\n**Filename pattern:** `{timestamp}_{name}.sql` where timestamp is either an auto-generated `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` or a custom `--migration-id`.\n\n**Format (v1):**\n\n```sql\n-- chkit-migration-format: v1\n-- generated-at: 2026-01-02T03:04:05.678Z\n-- cli-version: 0.1.0\n-- definition-count: 1\n-- operation-count: 2\n-- rename-suggestion-count: 0\n-- risk-summary: safe=1, caution=0, danger=0\n-- rename-suggestion: kind=column table=app.users from=email to=user_email confidence=high\n\n-- operation: create_database key=database:app risk=safe\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS app;\n\n-- operation: create_table key=table:app.users risk=safe\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app.users (\n  `id` UInt64\n) ENGINE = MergeTree()\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\nORDER BY (id);\n```\n\nKey structural elements:\n1. **Header comments** (lines starting with `--`): machine-parseable metadata including format version, generation timestamp, CLI version, operation count, risk summary, and rename suggestions.\n2. **Operation comments** (`-- operation: {type} key={key} risk={risk}`): each operation is preceded by a structured comment that the safety marker system can parse.\n3. **SQL statements**: the actual executable DDL.\n\nThe safety markers system (`/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/safety-markers.ts`) parses these structured comments to:\n- Extract executable statements (filtering out comments) via `extractExecutableStatements()`\n- Detect destructive operations (risk=danger) via `migrationContainsDangerOperation()` and `extractDestructiveOperationSummaries()`\n- Extract operation metadata for table scoping via `extractMigrationOperationSummaries()`\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the `migrate` command works\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts`\n\n### What it reads:\n\n1. **Snapshot** (`snapshot.json`) -- used only for table scoping (resolving `--table` selectors).\n2. **Journal** (`journal.json`) -- to determine which migrations have already been applied.\n3. **Migration directory** -- lists all `.sql` files sorted alphabetically.\n4. **Migration SQL files** -- reads content for checksum verification, destructive operation detection, table scoping, and execution.\n\n### Execution flow (lines 99-325):\n\n**Phase 1: Determine pending migrations**\n- Lists all `.sql` files in `migrationsDir`\n- Reads `journal.json` and builds a set of already-applied filenames\n- Filters out applied migrations to get the pending list\n- Runs **checksum verification** on already-applied migrations (compares SHA-256 of current file content against the stored checksum; if mismatch, it errors out with exit code 1)\n\n**Phase 2: Table scoping (optional)**\n- If `--table` is provided, reads each pending migration's operation comments and filters to only those whose operation keys match the selected tables\n\n**Phase 3: Plan vs Execute decision**\n- Without `--apply`/`--execute`: shows the pending list (plan mode) and prompts interactively for confirmation\n- With `--apply`/`--execute`: proceeds to execute\n- In CI/non-TTY: plan-only without `--apply`\n\n**Phase 4: Destructive operation gate**\n- Scans all pending migrations for `risk=danger` operations\n- Without `--allow-destructive`: blocks execution with exit code 3 in JSON mode, or prompts interactively for \"yes\" confirmation\n- With `--allow-destructive` or `safety.allowDestructive=true` in config: proceeds\n\n**Phase 5: Execution**\n- Creates a ClickHouse client from config\n- For each pending migration **in order**:\n  1. Reads the SQL file\n  2. Extracts executable statements (strips comments, splits on `;`)\n  3. Runs plugin hook `runOnBeforeApply()` (plugins can modify statements)\n  4. Executes each statement against ClickHouse via `db.execute()`\n  5. Creates a journal entry with `name`, `appliedAt` (current ISO timestamp), and `checksum` (SHA-256 of file content)\n  6. **Writes journal.json immediately** after each migration (line 300) -- this provides crash recovery: if the process dies mid-batch, previously applied migrations are recorded\n  7. Runs plugin hook `runOnAfterApply()`\n  8. Logs \"Applied: {filename}\"\n\n### What it writes:\n- Updates `journal.json` after each migration is applied (incremental writes, not a single batch)\n- Does NOT update `snapshot.json` (that is only updated by `generate`)\n\n---\n\n## 4. How the `status` command reports migration state\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts`\n\nThis is a read-only command that reports:\n\n1. Lists all `.sql` files in the migrations directory\n2. Reads the journal\n3. Computes pending = files not in journal's applied list\n4. Runs checksum mismatch detection (compares stored checksums against current file hashes)\n\n**Text output:**\n```\nMigrations directory: ./chkit/migrations\nTotal migrations:     3\nApplied:              1\nPending:              2\n\nPending migrations:\n- 20260101020000_add_column.sql\n- 20260101030000_add_index.sql\n\nChecksum mismatches on applied migrations:\n- 20260101000000_init.sql\n```\n\n**JSON output (--json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"status\",\n  \"schemaVersion\": 1,\n  \"migrationsDir\": \"./chkit/migrations\",\n  \"total\": 3,\n  \"applied\": 1,\n  \"pending\": 2,\n  \"pendingMigrations\": [\"20260101020000_add_column.sql\", \"20260101030000_add_index.sql\"],\n  \"checksumMismatchCount\": 1,\n  \"checksumMismatches\": [{\"name\": \"20260101000000_init.sql\", \"expected\": \"abc123\", \"actual\": \"def456\"}]\n}\n```\n\nThe status command does NOT connect to ClickHouse. It is purely a local file system operation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What `drift` and `check` do\n\n### drift command\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/drift.ts`\n**Comparison logic:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/drift.ts`\n\nThe `drift` command compares the **snapshot** (expected schema state) against the **live ClickHouse database** (actual state). It DOES connect to ClickHouse.\n\n**What it reads:**\n1. `snapshot.json` -- the expected schema definitions\n2. Live ClickHouse -- queries `system.tables`, `system.columns`, and `system.data_skipping_indices`\n\n**Comparison (in `buildDriftPayload`, lines 38-104 of drift.ts command file):**\n1. **Object-level comparison** (`compareSchemaObjects`): checks for missing objects, extra objects, and kind mismatches (e.g., expected a table but found a view)\n2. **Table-level comparison** (`compareTableShape`): for each table that exists in both snapshot and ClickHouse, compares:\n   - Columns: missing, extra, changed (type, nullable, default, comment)\n   - Indexes: name/expression/type/granularity mismatches\n   - Projections: name/query mismatches\n   - Settings: added, changed, removed settings\n   - Structural properties: TTL, engine, primary key, order by, unique key, partition by\n\n**Output includes reason codes** like `missing_column`, `extra_column`, `changed_column`, `setting_mismatch`, `index_mismatch`, `ttl_mismatch`, `engine_mismatch`, `primary_key_mismatch`, `order_by_mismatch`, `unique_key_mismatch`, `partition_by_mismatch`, `projection_mismatch`.\n\n### check command\n\n**File:** `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts`\n\nThe `check` command is a **CI/release gate** that combines multiple policy checks:\n\n1. **Pending migrations** -- fails if there are unapplied migrations (configurable via `check.failOnPending`)\n2. **Checksum mismatches** -- fails if applied migrations have been modified (configurable via `check.failOnChecksumMismatch`)\n3. **Schema drift** -- runs the drift check if ClickHouse config and snapshot exist; fails if drift is detected (configurable via `check.failOnDrift`)\n4. **Plugin checks** -- runs `onCheck` hooks from registered plugins\n\nEach policy can be individually enabled/disabled in the config or forced on with `--strict`. The command returns a structured result with `ok: boolean` and `failedChecks: string[]`.\n\n**Exit code:** 0 if all checks pass, 1 if any fail.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Full migration lifecycle\n\n```\nSchema files (TypeScript DSL)\n        |\n        v\n  [chkit generate]\n        |\n        +-- Reads: schema files + snapshot.json (previous state)\n        +-- Diffs: previous definitions vs. current definitions (planDiff in planner.ts)\n        +-- Writes: \n        |     - {timestamp}_{name}.sql -> migrationsDir\n        |     - snapshot.json -> metaDir (updated to current definitions)\n        v\n  [chkit status]  (read-only, local check)\n        |\n        +-- Reads: migrationsDir/*.sql + journal.json\n        +-- Reports: total, applied, pending, checksum mismatches\n        v\n  [chkit migrate]\n        |\n        +-- Reads: journal.json + migrationsDir/*.sql\n        +-- Verifies: checksum integrity of applied migrations\n        +-- Safety: blocks destructive operations without explicit opt-in\n        +-- Executes: SQL statements against ClickHouse (one migration at a time)\n        +-- Writes: journal.json (after each migration, incrementally)\n        v\n  [chkit drift]  (requires ClickHouse connection)\n        |\n        +-- Reads: snapshot.json + live ClickHouse system tables\n        +-- Reports: schema differences between expected and actual state\n        v\n  [chkit check]  (CI gate)\n        |\n        +-- Combines: pending check + checksum check + drift check + plugin checks\n        +-- Returns: pass/fail with specific failure reasons\n```\n\n**Key architectural decisions:**\n- Migration state is **entirely file-based** (no migration tracking table in ClickHouse)\n- Journal writes are **incremental per migration** for crash safety\n- Checksum verification provides **tamper detection** on already-applied migrations\n- The snapshot is the diff baseline, not the journal -- the journal only tracks \"what has been run\"\n- Drift detection compares snapshot (desired) vs. live database (actual), independently of the journal"}],"totalDurationMs":377753,"totalTokens":82207,"totalToolUseCount":32,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":123,"cache_read_input_tokens":78312,"output_tokens":3771,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":123,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0a4f4a11-26b7-4f2b-aea0-4cf2fa583980"}

Here is the full context:\n\n## Current State\n\nMigration tracking is stored in `./chkit/meta/journal.json` — a local file with this structure:\n```typescript\ninterface MigrationJournal {\n  version: 1\n  applied: MigrationJournalEntry[]\n}\ninterface MigrationJournalEntry {\n  name: string       // filename, e.g. \"20260101000000_init.sql\"\n  appliedAt: string   // ISO 8601 timestamp\n  checksum: string    // SHA-256 hex digest of migration SQL\n}\n```\n\nThis is read/written by `packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` (the `MigrationStore` abstraction).\n\n### Key consumers of journal state:\n1. **migrate command** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts`): reads journal to find pending migrations, writes journal after each applied migration\n2. **status command** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts`): reads journal to report applied/pending counts and checksum mismatches\n3. **check command** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts`): reads journal for pending check and checksum mismatch check\n\n### The migration-store.ts abstraction\nThe `MigrationStore` class in `packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` provides:\n- `readJournal()` → returns the journal (or empty journal if file doesn't exist)\n- `writeJournal(journal)` → writes journal.json\n- `readSnapshot()` → reads snapshot.json\n- Also handles legacy format normalization\n\n### Problem\nThe local journal doesn't support multi-environment deployments. If you have staging and production, you'd need separate journal files for each, but they live in the repo. The journal should be stored in ClickHouse so each environment tracks its own migration state.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Store migration journal in a ClickHouse table instead of (or in addition to) a local file\n2. Each ClickHouse environment (staging, prod) independently tracks which migrations have been applied to it\n3.

Here is my detailed implementation plan.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan: ClickHouse-backed Migration Journal\n\n### 1. ClickHouse Table Schema\n\nThe migration tracking table will live in the user's configured database with a `_chkit_` prefix. The table name will be `_chkit_migrations`.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _chkit_migrations (\n    name String,\n    applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n    checksum String,\n    chkit_version String\n)\nENGINE = MergeTree()\nORDER BY (name)\nSETTINGS index_granularity = 1\n```\n\n**Design rationale:**\n- `MergeTree()` is the most portable engine. For clustered setups, ClickHouse Cloud already uses `SharedMergeTree` under the hood when you say `MergeTree()`, so this is forward-compatible. Users on self-hosted replicated clusters could be given a future config option for `ReplicatedMergeTree`, but `MergeTree()` is the right default.\n- `ORDER BY (name)` ensures efficient lookups by migration name (the primary query pattern).\n- `index_granularity = 1` is appropriate because this table will have very few rows (typically tens to hundreds, never millions).\n- `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')` gives millisecond precision with explicit UTC timezone, matching the ISO 8601 strings used today.\n- `chkit_version` records which CLI version applied the migration, useful for debugging.\n\nThe table name `_chkit_migrations` is chosen because:\n- The leading underscore signals it is an internal/system table.\n- It lives in the user's configured database, so no `CREATE DATABASE` privilege is needed.\n- The drift detection in `listSchemaObjects` only scopes to databases that appear in the snapshot definitions, so this table will naturally be filtered out unless the user's schema definitions happen to target the same database. We will additionally exclude `_chkit_` prefixed tables in the drift comparison as a safety measure.\n\n### 2. Bootstrap Strategy\n\nThe tracking table must exist before migrations can be recorded. The bootstrap approach:\n\n**Auto-bootstrap on first use.** When the `ClickHouseJournalStore` is instantiated and its `readJournal()` or `writeJournal()` is first called, it issues a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement. This is idempotent and safe to run on every invocation.\n\nThe bootstrap SQL is not tracked as a migration itself -- it is infrastructure that the tool manages, similar to how ORMs create their own migration tracking tables.\n\n```typescript\nasync ensureTable(): Promise<void> {\n    if (this.bootstrapped) return\n    await this.db.execute(`\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${this.tableName} (\n            name String,\n            applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n            checksum String,\n            chkit_version String\n        )\n        ENGINE = MergeTree()\n        ORDER BY (name)\n        SETTINGS index_granularity = 1\n    `)\n    this.bootstrapped = true\n}\n```\n\nThis `ensureTable()` is called lazily at the start of `readJournal()` and `writeEntry()`. The `bootstrapped` flag avoids redundant DDL on repeated calls in the same process.\n\n### 3. Changes to migration-store.ts: Introduce JournalStore Interface\n\nThe key architectural change is to extract the journal read/write operations behind a `JournalStore` interface, then provide two implementations.\n\n**New file: `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts`**\n\n```typescript\nimport type { MigrationJournal, MigrationJournalEntry } from './migration-store.js'\n\nexport interface JournalStore {\n    readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal>\n    appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\n**`appendEntry` instead of `writeJournal`:** The current pattern in `migrate.ts` mutates the in-memory journal array, then writes the entire journal back. For the ClickHouse implementation, an `INSERT` is more natural and safer (no read-modify-write race). The local file implementation of `appendEntry` will read the current journal, append the entry, and write the full file.\n\n**Implementation: `LocalJournalStore`** (in `journal-store.ts`)\n\nWraps the existing `readJournal` and `writeJournal` functions from `migration-store.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nexport class LocalJournalStore implements JournalStore {\n    constructor(private metaDir: string) {}\n\n    async readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal> {\n        return readJournal(this.metaDir)\n    }\n\n    async appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void> {\n        const journal = await readJournal(this.metaDir)\n        journal.applied.push(entry)\n        await writeJournal(this.metaDir, journal)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation: `ClickHouseJournalStore`** (in `journal-store.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nexport class ClickHouseJournalStore implements JournalStore {\n    private bootstrapped = false\n    private tableName: string\n\n    constructor(\n        private db: ClickHouseExecutor,\n        private cliVersion: string,\n        tableName?: string\n    ) {\n        this.tableName = tableName ?? '_chkit_migrations'\n    }\n\n    private async ensureTable(): Promise<void> {\n        if (this.bootstrapped) return\n        await this.db.execute(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${this.tableName} ...`)\n        this.bootstrapped = true\n    }\n\n    async readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal> {\n        await this.ensureTable()\n        const rows = await this.db.query<{\n            name: string\n            applied_at: string\n            checksum: string\n        }>(`SELECT name, applied_at, checksum FROM ${this.tableName} ORDER BY name`)\n\n        return {\n            version: 1,\n            applied: rows.map(row => ({\n                name: row.name,\n                appliedAt: row.applied_at,\n                checksum: row.checksum,\n            })),\n        }\n    }\n\n    async appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void> {\n        await this.ensureTable()\n        await this.db.insert({\n            table: this.tableName,\n            values: [{\n                name: entry.name,\n                applied_at: entry.appliedAt,\n                checksum: entry.checksum,\n                chkit_version: this.cliVersion,\n            }],\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Factory function: `createJournalStore`**\n\n```typescript\nexport function createJournalStore(options: {\n    mode: 'local' | 'clickhouse'\n    metaDir: string\n    db?: ClickHouseExecutor\n    cliVersion?: string\n    tableName?: string\n}): JournalStore {\n    if (options.mode === 'clickhouse') {\n        if (!options.db) throw new Error('ClickHouse executor required for online journal')\n        return new ClickHouseJournalStore(\n            options.db,\n            options.cliVersion ?? 'unknown',\n            options.tableName\n        )\n    }\n    return new LocalJournalStore(options.metaDir)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Changes to Commands\n\n#### 4.1 Add `--local` Global Flag\n\nIn `packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts`, add:\n\n```typescript\n{ name: '--local', type: 'boolean', description: 'Use local journal file instead of ClickHouse' }\n```\n\nThis flag will be available on all commands.\n\n#### 4.2 Journal Store Resolution Logic\n\nAdd a helper function (in `journal-store.ts` or a new utility) to determine which store to use:\n\n```typescript\nexport function resolveJournalMode(config: ResolvedChxConfig, localFlag: boolean): 'local' | 'clickhouse' {\n    if (localFlag) return 'local'\n    if (config.clickhouse) return 'clickhouse'\n    return 'local'\n}\n```\n\nThe logic is:\n- If `--local` is passed, always use the local file journal.\n- If `config.clickhouse` is configured, use the ClickHouse journal (this is the new default).\n- If no ClickHouse config exists, fall back to local (for `generate`-only workflows where no CH is needed).\n\n#### 4.3 migrate.ts Changes\n\nThe `cmdMigrate` function currently:\n1. Reads journal via `readJournal(metaDir)` (line 121)\n2. Writes journal via `writeJournal(metaDir, journal)` (line 300)\n\nChanges:\n1. Import and create a `JournalStore` based on `resolveJournalMode(config, f['--local'])`.\n2. Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n3. Replace `writeJournal(metaDir, journal)` with `journalStore.appendEntry(entry)`.\n4. The `createClickHouseExecutor` call on line 273 already exists for executing migrations. The same executor instance should be reused for the `ClickHouseJournalStore` to avoid creating a second connection.\n5. When using ClickHouse journal, the JSON output `journalFile` key should change to `journalTable` to reflect the new storage location.\n\n**Important ordering consideration:** Currently the executor is created only when `--apply` is confirmed (line 273). The journal store needs to be readable before execution begins (for determining pending migrations). When mode is `clickhouse`, we need to create the executor earlier -- at the point where journal is first read (line 121). This means the executor creation should move up, and the `config.clickhouse` check should happen at journal-read time rather than at execute time.\n\nRevised flow:\n```\n1. Determine journal mode (local or clickhouse)\n2. If clickhouse mode, validate config.clickhouse exists, create executor\n3. Create JournalStore\n4. Read journal from store\n5. Determine pending migrations\n6. If executing: reuse the same executor for migration SQL\n7. After each migration, call journalStore.appendEntry(entry)\n```\n\n#### 4.4 status.ts Changes\n\nThe `cmdStatus` function currently reads the journal at line 21 with `readJournal(metaDir)`.\n\nChanges:\n1. Resolve journal mode: if `--local` is passed, use local; otherwise use ClickHouse if configured.\n2. If ClickHouse mode, create an executor and a `ClickHouseJournalStore`.\n3. Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n4. The `findChecksumMismatches` function currently reads migration SQL files from disk and compares checksums. This continues to work unchanged -- it takes a `MigrationJournal` object and a `migrationsDir`, both of which are still available.\n\n**Status currently does NOT connect to ClickHouse at all.** With this change, `status` will require a ClickHouse connection when ClickHouse is configured (unless `--local` is passed). This is the expected behavior per the user's specification.\n\n#### 4.5 check.ts Changes\n\nSame pattern as status. The `cmdCheck` function reads the journal at line 26. Replace with `JournalStore`.\n\nNote: `check` may already connect to ClickHouse for drift detection (line 31), so adding a connection for journal reading is not a new requirement.\n\n### 5. Configuration Changes\n\nNo new configuration fields are needed for the initial implementation. The behavior is:\n\n- **If `config.clickhouse` is set**: journal is stored in ClickHouse by default.\n- **If `config.clickhouse` is NOT set**: journal falls back to local file (e.g., for `generate`-only or offline workflows).\n- **`--local` flag**: overrides to use local journal regardless.\n\n**Future optional config** (not in scope for initial implementation, but the design should accommodate it):\n\n```typescript\ninterface ChxUserConfig {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n    journal?: {\n        tableName?: string  // default: '_chkit_migrations'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Backwards Compatibility Strategy\n\nSince the user wants to **remove** the local journal as the default, the migration path is:\n\n1. **Existing users with local journals**: When ClickHouse journal mode is active and the local `journal.json` exists, the CLI should detect this and offer a one-time migration. This could be a `chkit migrate --import-journal` command or an automatic prompt.\n\n2. **One-time journal import**: A new subcommand or flag that:\n   - Reads `journal.json` from the local metaDir\n   - Inserts all entries into the ClickHouse `_chkit_migrations` table\n   - Renames/moves `journal.json` to `journal.json.bak` to prevent confusion\n   - Emits a success message\n\n3. **Conflict detection**: If both a local journal and a ClickHouse journal exist, and the user is not in `--local` mode, the CLI should warn and suggest running the import.\n\nImplementation approach for the import:\n\n```typescript\n// In migrate command, before reading journal:\nif (mode === 'clickhouse' && localJournalExists(metaDir)) {\n    const localJournal = await readJournalFromFile(metaDir)\n    const chJournal = await chJournalStore.readJournal()\n    \n    if (chJournal.applied.length === 0 && localJournal.applied.length > 0) {\n        // Auto-import or prompt\n        throw new Error(\n            'Local journal.json detected but ClickHouse journal is empty. ' +\n            'Run `chkit migrate --import-journal` to migrate your journal to ClickHouse, ' +\n            'or use --local to continue using the local file.'\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Drift Detection Exclusion\n\nThe `_chkit_migrations` table must be excluded from drift detection so it does not appear as an \"extra\" object.\n\nIn `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts`, the `listSchemaObjects` query currently filters out `system`, `information_schema`, and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` databases. Since `_chkit_migrations` lives in the user's database, we need to filter it by table name instead.\n\nTwo options:\n- **Option A**: Add a name filter to the SQL query: `AND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'`\n- **Option B**: Filter the results in the drift comparison code.\n\nOption A is cleaner and more efficient. Modify the `listSchemaObjects` query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT database, name, engine\nFROM system.tables\nWHERE is_temporary = 0\n  AND database NOT IN ('system', 'information_schema', 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA')\n  AND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'\n```\n\nThis is a safe convention: any table starting with `_chkit_` is reserved for chkit internal use and excluded from drift.\n\n### 8. Edge Cases and Error Handling\n\n**8.1 ClickHouse unreachable during `status`/`check`**\n- If the ClickHouse connection fails, throw a clear error: \"Cannot read migration journal: ClickHouse connection failed. Use --local to read from local journal file.\"\n- Do NOT silently fall back. The user needs to know the source of truth is unavailable.\n\n**8.2 Concurrent migration execution**\n- ClickHouse `INSERT` is append-only; two processes inserting the same migration name would result in duplicates. Add a pre-check: before inserting a new entry, verify the migration name is not already in the table. Use `SELECT count() FROM _chkit_migrations WHERE name = {name}` before insert.\n- If a duplicate is found, throw: \"Migration {name} is already recorded in the journal. This may indicate concurrent execution.\"\n\n**8.3 Empty ClickHouse journal with existing local journal**\n- Detected and handled by the import mechanism described in section 6.\n\n**8.4 `generate` command**\n- The `generate` command does NOT read the journal. It reads the snapshot. No changes needed for `generate`. The snapshot remains a local file.\n\n**8.5 Table name conflicts**\n- If the user has a table named `_chkit_migrations` in their schema definitions, the CLI should detect this during `generate` and error: \"Table name '_chkit_migrations' is reserved for chkit internal use.\"\n\n**8.6 ClickHouse credentials in CI**\n- No change needed. Users already configure `config.clickhouse` with credentials (often via environment variables in the config function). The journal store reuses the same config.\n\n**8.7 Read-after-write consistency**\n- ClickHouse MergeTree is eventually consistent for `SELECT` after `INSERT`. However, with `wait_end_of_query: 1` already set in the client config, the insert is synchronous. A subsequent `SELECT` on the same connection should see the inserted row. This is safe for the migration loop where we insert one entry and then continue to the next migration.\n\n### 9.

Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Create `journal-store.ts`** with the interface, both implementations, and factory function. This is the core new abstraction with no dependencies on existing code changes.\n\n2. **Add `--local` flag** to `global-flags.ts`.\n\n3. **Update `migrate.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. This is the most complex change due to the executor lifecycle refactoring.\n\n4. **Update `status.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. Simpler change since it is read-only.\n\n5. **Update `check.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. Similar to status.\n\n6. **Add `_chkit_` exclusion** to `listSchemaObjects` in `@chkit/clickhouse`.\n\n7. **Add journal import detection** to `migrate.ts` (warn when local journal exists but CH journal is empty).\n\n8. **Write tests:**\n   - Unit tests for `ClickHouseJournalStore` (mocked executor)\n   - Unit tests for `LocalJournalStore` (reusing existing patterns)\n   - Unit tests for `resolveJournalMode`\n   - E2E tests for `migrate`, `status`, `check` with `--local` flag\n   - Live CH e2e test for the full flow (following `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts` patterns)\n\n9. **Update `lib.ts` exports** to include new types.\n\n10. **Create changeset** describing the feature.\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` - Contains the existing journal read/write functions that the new `LocalJournalStore` wraps, and the interfaces (`MigrationJournal`, `MigrationJournalEntry`) that the new `JournalStore` interface depends on\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` - Primary consumer of journal state; requires the most complex refactoring to use `JournalStore`, move executor creation earlier, and add import detection\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` - Houses the `ClickHouseExecutor` interface (with `execute`, `query`, `insert` methods) that `ClickHouseJournalStore` depends on, and the `listSchemaObjects` query that needs the `_chkit_` exclusion\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts` - Where the `--local` flag must be added\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` - Simplest command consumer to refactor first as a proof-of-concept for the `JournalStore` integration pattern"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a8e5756 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 93465\ntool_uses: 40\nduration_ms: 505505</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"ef33261b-1c73-402d-bd5a-aeb86b1219c8","timestamp":"2026-02-24T06:26:01.246Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to design a plan for moving migration state tracking from a local `journal.json` file into ClickHouse itself.

ClickHouse Table Schema\n\nThe migration tracking table will live in the user's configured database with a `_chkit_` prefix. The table name will be `_chkit_migrations`.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _chkit_migrations (\n    name String,\n    applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n    checksum String,\n    chkit_version String\n)\nENGINE = MergeTree()\nORDER BY (name)\nSETTINGS index_granularity = 1\n```\n\n**Design rationale:**\n- `MergeTree()` is the most portable engine. For clustered setups, ClickHouse Cloud already uses `SharedMergeTree` under the hood when you say `MergeTree()`, so this is forward-compatible. Users on self-hosted replicated clusters could be given a future config option for `ReplicatedMergeTree`, but `MergeTree()` is the right default.\n- `ORDER BY (name)` ensures efficient lookups by migration name (the primary query pattern).\n- `index_granularity = 1` is appropriate because this table will have very few rows (typically tens to hundreds, never millions).\n- `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')` gives millisecond precision with explicit UTC timezone, matching the ISO 8601 strings used today.\n- `chkit_version` records which CLI version applied the migration, useful for debugging.\n\nThe table name `_chkit_migrations` is chosen because:\n- The leading underscore signals it is an internal/system table.\n- It lives in the user's configured database, so no `CREATE DATABASE` privilege is needed.\n- The drift detection in `listSchemaObjects` only scopes to databases that appear in the snapshot definitions, so this table will naturally be filtered out unless the user's schema definitions happen to target the same database. We will additionally exclude `_chkit_` prefixed tables in the drift comparison as a safety measure.\n\n### 2. Bootstrap Strategy\n\nThe tracking table must exist before migrations can be recorded. The bootstrap approach:\n\n**Auto-bootstrap on first use.** When the `ClickHouseJournalStore` is instantiated and its `readJournal()` or `writeJournal()` is first called, it issues a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement. This is idempotent and safe to run on every invocation.\n\nThe bootstrap SQL is not tracked as a migration itself -- it is infrastructure that the tool manages, similar to how ORMs create their own migration tracking tables.\n\n```typescript\nasync ensureTable(): Promise<void> {\n    if (this.bootstrapped) return\n    await this.db.execute(`\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${this.tableName} (\n            name String,\n            applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n            checksum String,\n            chkit_version String\n        )\n        ENGINE = MergeTree()\n        ORDER BY (name)\n        SETTINGS index_granularity = 1\n    `)\n    this.bootstrapped = true\n}\n```\n\nThis `ensureTable()` is called lazily at the start of `readJournal()` and `writeEntry()`. The `bootstrapped` flag avoids redundant DDL on repeated calls in the same process.\n\n### 3. Changes to migration-store.ts: Introduce JournalStore Interface\n\nThe key architectural change is to extract the journal read/write operations behind a `JournalStore` interface, then provide two implementations.\n\n**New file: `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts`**\n\n```typescript\nimport type { MigrationJournal, MigrationJournalEntry } from './migration-store.js'\n\nexport interface JournalStore {\n    readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal>\n    appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\n**`appendEntry` instead of `writeJournal`:** The current pattern in `migrate.ts` mutates the in-memory journal array, then writes the entire journal back. For the ClickHouse implementation, an `INSERT` is more natural and safer (no read-modify-write race). The local file implementation of `appendEntry` will read the current journal, append the entry, and write the full file.\n\n**Implementation: `LocalJournalStore`** (in `journal-store.ts`)\n\nWraps the existing `readJournal` and `writeJournal` functions from `migration-store.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nexport class LocalJournalStore implements JournalStore {\n    constructor(private metaDir: string) {}\n\n    async readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal> {\n        return readJournal(this.metaDir)\n    }\n\n    async appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void> {\n        const journal = await readJournal(this.metaDir)\n        journal.applied.push(entry)\n        await writeJournal(this.metaDir, journal)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation: `ClickHouseJournalStore`** (in `journal-store.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nexport class ClickHouseJournalStore implements JournalStore {\n    private bootstrapped = false\n    private tableName: string\n\n    constructor(\n        private db: ClickHouseExecutor,\n        private cliVersion: string,\n        tableName?: string\n    ) {\n        this.tableName = tableName ?? '_chkit_migrations'\n    }\n\n    private async ensureTable(): Promise<void> {\n        if (this.bootstrapped) return\n        await this.db.execute(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${this.tableName} ...`)\n        this.bootstrapped = true\n    }\n\n    async readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal> {\n        await this.ensureTable()\n        const rows = await this.db.query<{\n            name: string\n            applied_at: string\n            checksum: string\n        }>(`SELECT name, applied_at, checksum FROM ${this.tableName} ORDER BY name`)\n\n        return {\n            version: 1,\n            applied: rows.map(row => ({\n                name: row.name,\n                appliedAt: row.applied_at,\n                checksum: row.checksum,\n            })),\n        }\n    }\n\n    async appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void> {\n        await this.ensureTable()\n        await this.db.insert({\n            table: this.tableName,\n            values: [{\n                name: entry.name,\n                applied_at: entry.appliedAt,\n                checksum: entry.checksum,\n                chkit_version: this.cliVersion,\n            }],\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Factory function: `createJournalStore`**\n\n```typescript\nexport function createJournalStore(options: {\n    mode: 'local' | 'clickhouse'\n    metaDir: string\n    db?: ClickHouseExecutor\n    cliVersion?: string\n    tableName?: string\n}): JournalStore {\n    if (options.mode === 'clickhouse') {\n        if (!options.db) throw new Error('ClickHouse executor required for online journal')\n        return new ClickHouseJournalStore(\n            options.db,\n            options.cliVersion ?? 'unknown',\n            options.tableName\n        )\n    }\n    return new LocalJournalStore(options.metaDir)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Changes to Commands\n\n#### 4.1 Add `--local` Global Flag\n\nIn `packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts`, add:\n\n```typescript\n{ name: '--local', type: 'boolean', description: 'Use local journal file instead of ClickHouse' }\n```\n\nThis flag will be available on all commands.\n\n#### 4.2 Journal Store Resolution Logic\n\nAdd a helper function (in `journal-store.ts` or a new utility) to determine which store to use:\n\n```typescript\nexport function resolveJournalMode(config: ResolvedChxConfig, localFlag: boolean): 'local' | 'clickhouse' {\n    if (localFlag) return 'local'\n    if (config.clickhouse) return 'clickhouse'\n    return 'local'\n}\n```\n\nThe logic is:\n- If `--local` is passed, always use the local file journal.\n- If `config.clickhouse` is configured, use the ClickHouse journal (this is the new default).\n- If no ClickHouse config exists, fall back to local (for `generate`-only workflows where no CH is needed).\n\n#### 4.3 migrate.ts Changes\n\nThe `cmdMigrate` function currently:\n1. Reads journal via `readJournal(metaDir)` (line 121)\n2. Writes journal via `writeJournal(metaDir, journal)` (line 300)\n\nChanges:\n1. Import and create a `JournalStore` based on `resolveJournalMode(config, f['--local'])`.\n2. Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n3. Replace `writeJournal(metaDir, journal)` with `journalStore.appendEntry(entry)`.\n4. The `createClickHouseExecutor` call on line 273 already exists for executing migrations. The same executor instance should be reused for the `ClickHouseJournalStore` to avoid creating a second connection.\n5. When using ClickHouse journal, the JSON output `journalFile` key should change to `journalTable` to reflect the new storage location.\n\n**Important ordering consideration:** Currently the executor is created only when `--apply` is confirmed (line 273). The journal store needs to be readable before execution begins (for determining pending migrations). When mode is `clickhouse`, we need to create the executor earlier -- at the point where journal is first read (line 121). This means the executor creation should move up, and the `config.clickhouse` check should happen at journal-read time rather than at execute time.\n\nRevised flow:\n```\n1. Determine journal mode (local or clickhouse)\n2. If clickhouse mode, validate config.clickhouse exists, create executor\n3. Create JournalStore\n4. Read journal from store\n5. Determine pending migrations\n6. If executing: reuse the same executor for migration SQL\n7. After each migration, call journalStore.appendEntry(entry)\n```\n\n#### 4.4 status.ts Changes\n\nThe `cmdStatus` function currently reads the journal at line 21 with `readJournal(metaDir)`.\n\nChanges:\n1. Resolve journal mode: if `--local` is passed, use local; otherwise use ClickHouse if configured.\n2. If ClickHouse mode, create an executor and a `ClickHouseJournalStore`.\n3. Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n4. The `findChecksumMismatches` function currently reads migration SQL files from disk and compares checksums. This continues to work unchanged -- it takes a `MigrationJournal` object and a `migrationsDir`, both of which are still available.\n\n**Status currently does NOT connect to ClickHouse at all.** With this change, `status` will require a ClickHouse connection when ClickHouse is configured (unless `--local` is passed). This is the expected behavior per the user's specification.\n\n#### 4.5 check.ts Changes\n\nSame pattern as status. The `cmdCheck` function reads the journal at line 26. Replace with `JournalStore`.\n\nNote: `check` may already connect to ClickHouse for drift detection (line 31), so adding a connection for journal reading is not a new requirement.\n\n### 5. Configuration Changes\n\nNo new configuration fields are needed for the initial implementation. The behavior is:\n\n- **If `config.clickhouse` is set**: journal is stored in ClickHouse by default.\n- **If `config.clickhouse` is NOT set**: journal falls back to local file (e.g., for `generate`-only or offline workflows).\n- **`--local` flag**: overrides to use local journal regardless.\n\n**Future optional config** (not in scope for initial implementation, but the design should accommodate it):\n\n```typescript\ninterface ChxUserConfig {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n    journal?: {\n        tableName?: string  // default: '_chkit_migrations'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Backwards Compatibility Strategy\n\nSince the user wants to **remove** the local journal as the default, the migration path is:\n\n1. **Existing users with local journals**: When ClickHouse journal mode is active and the local `journal.json` exists, the CLI should detect this and offer a one-time migration. This could be a `chkit migrate --import-journal` command or an automatic prompt.\n\n2. **One-time journal import**: A new subcommand or flag that:\n   - Reads `journal.json` from the local metaDir\n   - Inserts all entries into the ClickHouse `_chkit_migrations` table\n   - Renames/moves `journal.json` to `journal.json.bak` to prevent confusion\n   - Emits a success message\n\n3. **Conflict detection**: If both a local journal and a ClickHouse journal exist, and the user is not in `--local` mode, the CLI should warn and suggest running the import.\n\nImplementation approach for the import:\n\n```typescript\n// In migrate command, before reading journal:\nif (mode === 'clickhouse' && localJournalExists(metaDir)) {\n    const localJournal = await readJournalFromFile(metaDir)\n    const chJournal = await chJournalStore.readJournal()\n    \n    if (chJournal.applied.length === 0 && localJournal.applied.length > 0) {\n        // Auto-import or prompt\n        throw new Error(\n            'Local journal.json detected but ClickHouse journal is empty. ' +\n            'Run `chkit migrate --import-journal` to migrate your journal to ClickHouse, ' +\n            'or use --local to continue using the local file.'\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Drift Detection Exclusion\n\nThe `_chkit_migrations` table must be excluded from drift detection so it does not appear as an \"extra\" object.\n\nIn `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts`, the `listSchemaObjects` query currently filters out `system`, `information_schema`, and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` databases. Since `_chkit_migrations` lives in the user's database, we need to filter it by table name instead.\n\nTwo options:\n- **Option A**: Add a name filter to the SQL query: `AND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'`\n- **Option B**: Filter the results in the drift comparison code.\n\nOption A is cleaner and more efficient. Modify the `listSchemaObjects` query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT database, name, engine\nFROM system.tables\nWHERE is_temporary = 0\n  AND database NOT IN ('system', 'information_schema', 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA')\n  AND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'\n```\n\nThis is a safe convention: any table starting with `_chkit_` is reserved for chkit internal use and excluded from drift.\n\n### 8. Edge Cases and Error Handling\n\n**8.1 ClickHouse unreachable during `status`/`check`**\n- If the ClickHouse connection fails, throw a clear error: \"Cannot read migration journal: ClickHouse connection failed. Use --local to read from local journal file.\"\n- Do NOT silently fall back. The user needs to know the source of truth is unavailable.\n\n**8.2 Concurrent migration execution**\n- ClickHouse `INSERT` is append-only; two processes inserting the same migration name would result in duplicates. Add a pre-check: before inserting a new entry, verify the migration name is not already in the table. Use `SELECT count() FROM _chkit_migrations WHERE name = {name}` before insert.\n- If a duplicate is found, throw: \"Migration {name} is already recorded in the journal. This may indicate concurrent execution.\"\n\n**8.3 Empty ClickHouse journal with existing local journal**\n- Detected and handled by the import mechanism described in section 6.\n\n**8.4 `generate` command**\n- The `generate` command does NOT read the journal. It reads the snapshot. No changes needed for `generate`. The snapshot remains a local file.\n\n**8.5 Table name conflicts**\n- If the user has a table named `_chkit_migrations` in their schema definitions, the CLI should detect this during `generate` and error: \"Table name '_chkit_migrations' is reserved for chkit internal use.\"\n\n**8.6 ClickHouse credentials in CI**\n- No change needed. Users already configure `config.clickhouse` with credentials (often via environment variables in the config function). The journal store reuses the same config.\n\n**8.7 Read-after-write consistency**\n- ClickHouse MergeTree is eventually consistent for `SELECT` after `INSERT`. However, with `wait_end_of_query: 1` already set in the client config, the insert is synchronous. A subsequent `SELECT` on the same connection should see the inserted row. This is safe for the migration loop where we insert one entry and then continue to the next migration.\n\n### 9. File Changes Summary\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts` | **New file.** `JournalStore` interface, `LocalJournalStore`, `ClickHouseJournalStore`, `createJournalStore`, `resolveJournalMode` |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts` | Add `--local` flag |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` | Use `JournalStore` instead of direct `readJournal`/`writeJournal`. Move executor creation earlier. Add journal import detection. |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` | Use `JournalStore`. Create CH executor when needed. |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts` | Use `JournalStore`. Create CH executor when needed. |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` | Keep existing functions (used by `LocalJournalStore`). Export `checksumSQL`, `findChecksumMismatches`, `listMigrations`, `readSnapshot` unchanged. |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/lib.ts` | Export new `JournalStore` types for public API |\n| `packages/cli/src/plugins.ts` | No changes needed (CommandRunContext already has `config` and `dirs`) |\n| `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` | Add `_chkit_` exclusion to `listSchemaObjects` query |\n| `packages/core/src/model-types.ts` | Optionally add `journal?: { tableName?: string }` to `ChxUserConfig` (can be deferred) |\n\n### 10. Implementation Sequence\n\n1. **Create `journal-store.ts`** with the interface, both implementations, and factory function. This is the core new abstraction with no dependencies on existing code changes.\n\n2. **Add `--local` flag** to `global-flags.ts`.\n\n3. **Update `migrate.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. This is the most complex change due to the executor lifecycle refactoring.\n\n4. **Update `status.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. Simpler change since it is read-only.\n\n5. **Update `check.ts`** to use `JournalStore`. Similar to status.\n\n6. **Add `_chkit_` exclusion** to `listSchemaObjects` in `@chkit/clickhouse`.\n\n7. **Add journal import detection** to `migrate.ts` (warn when local journal exists but CH journal is empty).\n\n8. **Write tests:**\n   - Unit tests for `ClickHouseJournalStore` (mocked executor)\n   - Unit tests for `LocalJournalStore` (reusing existing patterns)\n   - Unit tests for `resolveJournalMode`\n   - E2E tests for `migrate`, `status`, `check` with `--local` flag\n   - Live CH e2e test for the full flow (following `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts` patterns)\n\n9. **Update `lib.ts` exports** to include new types.\n\n10. **Create changeset** describing the feature.\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` - Contains the existing journal read/write functions that the new `LocalJournalStore` wraps, and the interfaces (`MigrationJournal`, `MigrationJournalEntry`) that the new `JournalStore` interface depends on\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` - Primary consumer of journal state; requires the most complex refactoring to use `JournalStore`, move executor creation earlier, and add import detection\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` - Houses the `ClickHouseExecutor` interface (with `execute`, `query`, `insert` methods) that `ClickHouseJournalStore` depends on, and the `listSchemaObjects` query that needs the `_chkit_` exclusion\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts` - Where the `--local` flag must be added\n- `/Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/tianjin-v1/packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` - Simplest command consumer to refactor first as a proof-of-concept for the `JournalStore` integration pattern"}],"totalDurationMs":505505,"totalTokens":93465,"totalToolUseCount":40,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1024,"cache_read_input_tokens":87114,"output_tokens":5326,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1024,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d9d9493a-5768-4a13-9d9f-8a0cf3825334"}

This breaks multi-environment workflows — you can't use the same repo to manage staging and production because there's only one journal. Moving the journal into ClickHouse means each environment (each ClickHouse instance) independently tracks which migrations have been applied to it.\n\n## Design\n\n### 1. ClickHouse migration tracking table\n\nTable `_chkit_migrations` is created automatically in the user's configured database:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _chkit_migrations (\n    name String,\n    applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n    checksum String,\n    chkit_version String\n) ENGINE = MergeTree()\nORDER BY (name)\nSETTINGS index_granularity = 1\n```\n\n- `MergeTree()` is portable (ClickHouse Cloud maps it to `SharedMergeTree` automatically).\n- `ORDER BY (name)` — migrations are looked up by name.\n- `index_granularity = 1` — table will have very few rows.\n- `_chkit_` prefix signals internal use and provides a filtering convention.\n\n### 2. JournalStore interface\n\nNew file: `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface JournalStore {\n  readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal>\n  appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\nTwo implementations:\n\n- **`LocalJournalStore`** — wraps existing `readJournal()`/`writeJournal()` from `migration-store.ts`\n- **`ClickHouseJournalStore`** — reads/writes the `_chkit_migrations` table. Auto-bootstraps the table via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on first access (idempotent).\n\nFactory: `createJournalStore(config, db?)` returns the appropriate implementation based on whether `config.clickhouse` is set.\n\n### 3. Command changes\n\n**`migrate`** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts`):\n- When `config.clickhouse` exists, create the ClickHouse executor *before* reading the journal (currently it's created only when `--apply` is confirmed at line 273). The same executor is reused for both journal reads and migration execution.\n- Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` (line 121) with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n- Replace `writeJournal(metaDir, journal)` (line 300) with `journalStore.appendEntry(entry)`.\n- When using local fallback (no CH config), behavior is unchanged.\n\n**`status`** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts`):\n- Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` (line 21) with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n- When using ClickHouse journal, creates a connection (status currently doesn't connect to CH).\n\n**`check`** (`packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts`):\n- Replace `readJournal(metaDir)` (line 26) with `journalStore.readJournal()`.\n- Already may connect to CH for drift detection.\n\n### 4. New `--local` flag\n\nAdd to `GLOBAL_FLAGS` in `packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n{ name: '--local', type: 'boolean', description: 'Use local journal file instead of ClickHouse' }\n```\n\nResolution logic: `--local` → local file. Otherwise, if `config.clickhouse` is set → ClickHouse journal. Otherwise → local file.\n\n### 5. Drift detection exclusion\n\nIn `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts`, add to `listSchemaObjects()` query (line 163):\n\n```sql\nAND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'\n```\n\nThis prevents the tracking table from appearing as drift.\n\n### 6. Local journal import detection\n\nWhen ClickHouse journal mode is active and a local `journal.json` exists with entries, but the ClickHouse table is empty, emit a clear error suggesting the user run with `--local` or manually verify. (We can add a `--import-journal` command later if needed.)\n\n## Files to modify\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts` | **New.** `JournalStore` interface + both implementations + factory |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/global-flags.ts` | Add `--local` flag |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` | Use `JournalStore`, move executor creation earlier |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` | Use `JournalStore` |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts` | Use `JournalStore` |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/lib.ts` | Export `JournalStore` types |\n| `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` | Add `_chkit_` exclusion to `listSchemaObjects` |\n\n`migration-store.ts` is unchanged — its functions are still used by `LocalJournalStore` and for checksums/snapshots.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `bun run build && bun run typecheck` — all packages compile\n2. `bun run test` — existing tests pass\n3.

Drift detection exclusion\n\nIn `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts`, add to `listSchemaObjects()` query (line 163):\n\n```sql\nAND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'\n```\n\nPrevents the tracking table from showing up as unexpected drift.\n\n### 5. Remove local journal code\n\n- Remove `readJournal()` and `writeJournal()` from `migration-store.ts`.\n- Remove their exports from `lib.ts`.\n- Keep `checksumSQL`, `findChecksumMismatches`, `listMigrations`, `readSnapshot`, etc. — these are still needed.\n\n## Files to modify\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts` | **New.** `JournalStore` interface + `ClickHouseJournalStore` + factory |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` | Use `JournalStore`, move executor creation earlier, remove local journal writes |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` | Use `JournalStore`, require CH connection |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts` | Use `JournalStore`, require CH connection |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` | Remove `readJournal()` and `writeJournal()` |\n| `packages/cli/src/bin/lib.ts` | Remove `readJournal`/`writeJournal` exports, add `JournalStore` types |\n| `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` | Add `_chkit_` exclusion to `listSchemaObjects` |\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `bun run build && bun run typecheck` — all packages compile\n2. `bun run test` — existing tests pass (some may need updating for removed functions)\n3. Manual: `chkit status` with CH config — connects and reads from CH table\n4. Manual: `chkit migrate --apply` — records entries in CH table\n5. Manual: `chkit drift` — `_chkit_migrations` does not appear as drift\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1536,"cache_read_input_tokens":53623,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1536},"output_tokens":22,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYSSLF7gStkaVmCAJaATA","type":"assistant","uuid":"371a6bc3-88fc-4180-af14-53d2c12ee9ab","timestamp":"2026-02-24T06:41:16.587Z"}

Updated `migrate`, `status`, `check` commands to use the new journal store and require ClickHouse config\n3. Removed local journal read/write functions from `migration-store.ts`\n4. Updated exports in `lib.ts`\n5. Added exclusion for `_chkit_%` tables in drift detection\n6. Simplified many tests that previously tested local journal functionality\n\nThe main changes involve moving from local JSON file-based journal storage to ClickHouse-backed storage, which enables multi-environment deployments.\n\nLet me write a good commit message and then create the PR.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14569,"cache_read_input_tokens":58782,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":14569},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYSUG7HG2WvSw2iSJi3Nx","type":"assistant","uuid":"1270a30c-c3ce-41e7-9e44-53ecee075ce4","timestamp":"2026-02-24T07:06:35.917Z"}

Here's what was included:\n\n**PR: [Store migration journal in ClickHouse](https://github.com/obsessiondb/chkit/pull/46)**\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\nThe migration state tracking has been moved from a local `journal.json` file to a ClickHouse `_chkit_migrations` table, enabling multi-environment deployments where staging and production can each independently track their applied migrations.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- New `journal-store.ts` with `ClickHouseJournalStore` implementation\n- `migrate`, `status`, and `check` commands now require ClickHouse config\n- Auto-bootstrap of `_chkit_migrations` table via idempotent `CREATE TABLE`\n- Removed local file-based journal functions from `migration-store.ts`\n- Added `_chkit_%` table exclusion to drift detection\n- Simplified tests to reflect the ClickHouse requirement\n\nThe PR is ready for review at: **https://github.com/obsessiondb/chkit/pull/46**"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":376,"cache_read_input_tokens":89017,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":376},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYSUJEHFnPxWFKw4JHd46","type":"assistant","uuid":"990e17e0-2dcf-47c0-ac25-bf08f295364c","timestamp":"2026-02-24T07:07:04.520Z"}

The live e2e tests have `config.clickhouse` set with `database: 'default'`, but the `_chkit_migrations` table is created in the `default` database. The problem is that each test creates its own database (e.g., `chkit_e2e_1234_56789`) for the user tables, but the `_chkit_migrations` table is being created in the `default` database (since that's what `config.clickhouse.database` is set to).\n\nThe issue is that **all tests share the same `default` database for the journal table**. So when test A runs and inserts a migration entry into `_chkit_migrations`, test B (running concurrently) also sees those entries.\n \nLooking at the specific test failures, the migrate command succeeds and writes to the journal, but then status shows 0 applied migrations instead of 1—which suggests the entry is being written to the shared `default` database's `_chkit_migrations` table, but something's preventing status from reading it back correctly, possibly due to the concurrent test execution or a timing issue with how the tests are sharing that same journal table.\n\nThe real problem might be that each CLI invocation creates a fresh connection to ClickHouse—migrate writes its entry and closes, then status opens a new connection and queries the same table, but there could be a visibility or transaction isolation issue between these separate connections.\n\nBut actually, I'm noticing something more fundamental: all the tests run concurrently and they're all writing to the same `_chkit_migrations` table in the `default` database. Test 1 runs migrate successfully but then status reads zero applied entries from that shared table, which shouldn't happen if the write actually persisted.\n\nLooking at test 3's failure—where the second plan shows both migrations as pending even after the first one executed—this suggests the migration entry isn't being persisted or read correctly across the concurrent test runs, pointing to either a shared state issue or a consistency problem with how the table is being queried. indicates that the first migrate --execute did NOT record the first migration in the journal. So the migrate command succeeded in executing the SQL against ClickHouse but failed to write the journal entry.\n\nBut why would it fail silently? Let me re-read the migrate command flow:\n\nThe journalStore and database are created from the config, then for each pending migration file, the SQL gets executed and an entry is appended to the journal. If `appendEntry` failed, it would throw an error and the test would see a non-zero exit code. But the test shows `firstExecute.exitCode` is 0, so no error was thrown.\n\nMaybe the issue is with the `ClickHouseJournalStore` and how it accesses the database. The config specifies `database: 'default'`, and the executor creates a client with that database. The `_chkit_migrations` table name in the SQL doesn't have a database prefix, so it uses the configured default database, which should be correct.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a concurrency issue since the tests run with `--concurrent` and they all share the same `_chkit_migrations` table. the `default` database. But the specific failure patterns don't look like cross-contamination:\n- Test 1: applied = 0 (expected 1) — the entry just doesn't exist\n- Test 3: pending = 2 (expected 1) — neither migration is recorded\n\nThe issue might be that the test cleanup (`dropDatabase`) from a concurrent test is dropping the `default` database or the `_chkit_migrations` table. But `dropDatabase` drops the test-specific database (like `chkit_e2e_1234_56789`), not `default`.\n\nActually, I wonder if there's a read-after-write consistency issue with ClickHouse Cloud. The `wait_end_of_query: 1` setting should help, but MergeTree might still have eventual consistency for SELECTs. Let me look at that...\n\nEach CLI invocation creates a fresh ClickHouse connection, so the migrate command inserts and exits, then the status command opens a new connection to read. On ClickHouse Cloud with SharedMergeTree, there could be a visibility delay between when data is inserted and when it appears on a subsequent connection, even with `wait_end_of_query` enabled. The issue is that migrations are being applied but not showing up in subsequent status checks—either there's eventual consistency at play where the INSERT succeeds but isn't immediately visible to new connections, or the data is going somewhere unexpected. Let me trace through what's actually happening: the execute command reports applying 1 migration, but when status queries the journal right after, it reads 0 entries, which suggests the INSERT either isn't persisting or isn't being read back correctly. to a different location than where SELECT reads from\n\nActually wait, I think I might have found the issue. Each test creates its own CLI fixtures, each running in separate temporary directories. But they all share the same ClickHouse `default` database. The `_chkit_migrations` table is created in `default` and is shared. But the migration files have unique names (based on timestamps), so each test's migrations should be distinct entries.\n\nUnless... there's a ClickHouse Cloud eventual consistency issue with `SharedMergeTree`. The insert happens in one connection, and a select in a new connection might not see it immediately.\n\nLet me look at this from a different angle. The `drift.e2e.test.ts:308` failure is checking that the exit code is 0, but it's getting 1. The test runs `generate` then `migrate --execute`, adds drift, then runs `check` with `failOnDrift: false`. For the check to fail with exit code 1, either `failOnPending` or `failOnChecksumMismatch` must have triggered—and I'm suspecting the issue is that the check command is finding mismatches between what's recorded in `_chkit_migrations` and the local migration files. if it doesn't find the entry and thinks migrations are pending...\n\nWait, I think the `check` command might be finding migrations as \"pending\" because the journal table doesn't have the entries. That would cause `failOnPending` to be true, and check exits 1.\n\nSo the root cause across all 4 tests is the same: **journal entries written by `migrate --execute` are not visible to subsequent `status`/`check`/`migrate` commands**.\n\nI think this is a ClickHouse Cloud eventual consistency issue with `SharedMergeTree`. On ClickHouse Cloud, writes may not be immediately visible to reads from a new connection.\n\nOne fix could be to add `select_sequential_consistency = 1` to the `clickhouse_settings` when reading from the journal table.\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the `journal-store.ts` to make sure it's correct. I need to look at the new file the user created to understand how it's currently handling reads from the journal

The live e2e tests run against ClickHouse Cloud, which uses `SharedMergeTree` under the hood. The issue is that each CLI invocation (migrate, status, check) creates a **new** ClickHouse client connection. On ClickHouse Cloud, writes via one connection may not be immediately visible to reads via a different connection due to the distributed nature of `SharedMergeTree`.\n\nThe solution is to add `select_sequential_consistency = 1` to the read queries on the journal table, which forces the SELECT to wait until all preceding writes are visible. This ensures that after an INSERT in one connection, a SELECT from a new connection will see the data.\n\n\nI could add this setting globally in the client configuration, but that would affect all queries unnecessarily. Even though `wait_end_of_query: 1` is already set to ensure the server waits for query completion, it doesn't guarantee visibility across different connections on ClickHouse Cloud. The targeted approach is to add `SETTINGS select_sequential_consistency = 1` directly to the `readJournal` SELECT query to enforce sequential consistency for journal reads.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider this more carefully. With ClickHouse Cloud's SharedMergeTree, inserts go into parts that eventually merge, and SELECTs from different replicas might not immediately see recently inserted parts. Using `FINAL` would only force a merge pass on read but won't solve the cross-replica visibility issue, whereas `select_sequential_consistency = 1` is specifically designed to handle replica consistency guarantees.\n\nI can add this setting directly to the query using the `SETTINGS` clause, or configure it at the client level. The cleanest approach would be to set it in the client configuration rather than modifying every query.\n\nBut wait, I need to reconsider whether this is actually the root cause. The test spawns separate CLI processes for each command—the first process inserts the journal entry and exits, then the second process creates a fresh client connection to query the journal. Since the connections are separate and sequential, there shouldn't be a visibility issue between them.\n\nActually, on ClickHouse Cloud with SharedMergeTree, the insert is committed by the time the first process exits. But on a replicated setup, the new connection in the second process might route to a different replica that hasn't caught up yet. Adding `select_sequential_consistency = 1` to the readJournal query ensures we read from a node that's up-to-date with the

Since all tests use `database: 'default'` and share the same `_chkit_migrations` table, the entries from different tests will accumulate. But since each test has unique migration filenames (based on the generate timestamp), this shouldn't cause issues for correctness - the entries just won't match any migration files in other test fixtures.\n\nHowever, there could be a concern about the `_chkit_migrations` table growing indefinitely. But for CI tests, this isn't really a problem since the ClickHouse Cloud instance is shared and the entries are tiny.\n\n\nThe real priority is getting the `select_sequential_consistency` fix in place. The migration table cleanup isn't critical since the entries are minimal and won't impact test performance, so I'll focus on committing and pushing the main fix.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":579,"cache_read_input_tokens":138750,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":579},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYSUkXngd3NRMRD9yJmQj","type":"assistant","uuid":"f52a20f9-c81a-4b34-bba8-916bbe89d5b7","timestamp":"2026-02-24T07:13:07.582Z"}

The `select_sequential_consistency` fix didn't help. Let me dig deeper.\n\nLooking at the errors more carefully:\n\n1. `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts` test 1: `statusPayload.applied` expected 1, received 0\n2. `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts` test 2: `secondPlanPayload.pending.length` expected 1, received 2\n3. `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts` test 3: `check.exitCode` expected 0, received 1\n\n\n4. `drift.e2e.test.ts`: `checkResult.exitCode` expected 0, received 1\n\nAll 4 tests show the same pattern—after running `migrate --execute`, subsequent commands can't see the journal entries. The `select_sequential_consistency = 1` setting is in place locally, but it's still failing, which suggests the problem might not be about read consistency at all. I'm wondering if each test's fixture setup is the issue.\n\nSince all tests use `database: 'default'` and share the same `_chkit_migrations` table, concurrent test runs could be interfering with each other. When test A applies one migration and test B applies another, they both write to the same shared table, potentially polluting each other's results. Let me trace through what actually happens during a test run to understand where the entries disappear. The journal table appears to be empty, which means either the INSERT from the migrate command didn't persist or the table was cleared between calls. I'm wondering if there's a race condition where concurrent tests are interfering with the `_chkit_migrations` table creation or if the table is being created in a different database than expected.\n\nLooking at the `readJournal` function, it maps the database rows to populate the `applied` field, so the count should reflect all entries in the journal table.\n\nThe migrate command reported success with one entry applied, which means the INSERT succeeded, but then the subsequent status check returned zero entries. This suggests a consistency issue—maybe `select_sequential_consistency` isn't actually being honored on ClickHouse Cloud's `SharedMergeTree` tables, even though the migration table uses the base `MergeTree()` type that gets converted automatically.\n\nI'm considering a few alternatives: using `FINAL` in the SELECT to force a merge pass, or `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA` to ensure replication is caught up, though neither feels like the right fit. But actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this—let me step back and reconsider what's really happening here.\n\nThe tests run concurrently with a 15-second timeout, and they all share the `_chkit_migrations` table in the `default` database while using separate databases for their test tables. Looking at the actual failure, the status payload shows 0 applied migrations when it should show 1, meaning the SELECT query returned no rows even though the migrate command reported success. This suggests either the INSERT didn't actually persist, or the SELECT is hitting a different table entirely.\n\nI'm realizing that both the `migrate` and `status` commands create their own separate ClickHouse connections through `createJournalStoreFromConfig`, so they're not sharing a connection. They both reference `database: 'default'`, but maybe the `_chkit_migrations` table doesn't actually exist when the status command runs, or there's some issue with how the database context is being resolved.\n\nLet me look more carefully at the test cleanup logic to see if something's interfering with the default database or the migrations table itself.\n\nI'm now fairly convinced this is a read-after-write consistency issue with ClickHouse Cloud's SharedMergeTree engine, and `select_sequential_consistency` might not be handling it properly. I'm considering whether `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA` could help before the SELECT query, though that might not be available for SharedMergeTree either. Let me explore using specific query settings...\n\nThe real solution probably involves setting `insert_quorum = 'auto'` or `wait_for_async_insert` during the INSERT operation to ensure data is replicated before returning, and then using `select_sequential_consistency = 1` on the SELECT. The challenge is that the ClickHouse client's insert method doesn't directly support SETTINGS the way raw SQL does, so I'd need to use the execute method with a raw query instead, or potentially set these at the session level. I'm wondering if the `CLICKHOUSE_DB` environment variable is being used correctly, or if there's a mismatch between where the test config is writing data and where it's reading from. The client is hardcoded to use the `default` database, but maybe the journal entries are ending up somewhere else entirely.\n\nLet me try a different approach — instead of trying to pass settings through the query itself, I should set the session-level configuration directly on the client when it's initialized.\n\nLooking at how the ClickHouse client is created, it already has `wait_end_of_query` set at the client level. I'm wondering if I can add `select_sequential_consistency` there too, but that would apply it globally to all queries, when I really only need it for the journal store operations.\n\nLet me think through what's actually happening in the e2e test: the migration subprocess creates a client, inserts migration records, and exits, then the status subprocess creates a fresh client and tries to read those same records. The issue is likely a consistency problem between those two separate client instances.\n\nI'm realizing that `select_sequential_consistency` might not even solve this on ClickHouse Cloud since it's designed for replicated tables and might not work the same way with SharedMergeTree. Maybe the real problem is that the SETTINGS clause in the query string isn't being recognized by the client library at all. Let me try using a raw execute call instead to pass the settings directly.\n\nActually, looking at the exact error more carefully — the migrate command succeeds and shows one applied migration, but then the status check reads zero rows from `_chkit_migrations`. This could mean the table is being created as a LOCAL table on one node, and when the next query runs on a different node in the Cloud cluster, it can't see it. Even though MergeTree gets converted to SharedMergeTree, there might be a propagation delay for the table creation itself.\n\nLet me think through another angle: what if `_chkit_migrations` already existed from a previous test and concurrent tests are somehow interfering with it? No, there's no TRUNCATE logic in the code. Or maybe the real issue is that `CLICKHOUSE_DB` environment variable points to a database other than `default`, and the Cloud instance restricts operations to that specific database, so when the client tries to create the table in `default`, it's either failing silently or creating it in the wrong place.\n\nActually, I should just clean up the `_chkit_migrations` table at the start of each test to guarantee a fresh state, rather than continuing to chase down this consistency issue. client connects to the `default` database. But what if the `_chkit_migrations` table is being created in the `default` database, but the concurrent tests that `dropDatabase` their test-specific databases also somehow affect the `default` database?\n\nNo, `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS chkit_e2e_xxx` only drops that specific database.\n\nOK I think I need to just add some debugging to understand what's happening. But since I can't modify the CI environment, let me try a different fix.\n\nWhat if instead of relying on `select_sequential_consistency`, I clean up the `_chkit_migrations` table at the start of each test? The issue might be that residual entries from previous test runs are causing problems.\n\nWait, no — the error is that there are TOO FEW entries (0 instead of 1), not too many. So leftover entries would cause the opposite problem.\n\nLet me trace through the first test step by step: I'm creating a fixture with a temp directory and schema, then running init to set up the config, generating the migration SQL, checking the plan shows 1 pending migration, executing it, and finally checking the status. ', fixture.configPath, '--json'])` - should show 1 applied\n\nIn step 4 (plan mode), the `migrate` command:\n- Creates a ClickHouse executor (connects to ClickHouse Cloud)\n- Creates journal store\n- Calls `journalStore.readJournal()` which calls `ensureTable()` (creates `_chkit_migrations` if not exists) and then SELECTs\n- Lists migration files\n- Reports pending\n\nIn step 5 (execute mode), the `migrate` command:\n- Creates a NEW ClickHouse executor (new connection)\n- Creates journal store\n- Calls `journalStore.readJournal()` which calls `ensureTable()` again and SELECTs\n- Executes the migration SQL\n- Calls `journalStore.appendEntry()` which INSERTs into `_chkit_migrations`\n\nIn step 6 (status), the `status` command:\n- Creates a NEW ClickHouse executor (new connection)\n- Creates journal store\n- Calls `journalStore.readJournal()` which calls `ensureTable()` and SELECTs\n- Should find 1 row\n\nThe issue is that step 6's SELECT returns 0 rows even though step 5's INSERT succeeded. I'm wondering if the problem could be a database mismatch — what if ClickHouse Cloud defaults to a different database than \"default\"? That would mean step 5 inserts into one database while step 6 queries a different one.\n\nActually, I'm now thinking about concurrent test execution. Multiple tests run at the same time and all share the same `_chkit_migrations` table. What if one test's cleanup or failure is corrupting the table state for another test?\n\nThe cleanup only drops the test database, not the migrations table itself. But ClickHouse Cloud has built-in deduplication for inserts, which might be silently dropping duplicate migration entries and causing new ones to not appear. I'm reconsidering whether deduplication is actually the culprit here—the `applied_at` timestamps with millisecond precision should make each insert unique. Let me step back and look at ClickHouse Cloud's default settings instead, particularly around read-after-write consistency, rather than continuing down the deduplication path. Maybe I should try setting `select_sequential_consistency` at the client level instead.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the issue might be with how the client library handles the query. The executor's `query` method passes the SQL string directly to `client.query()`, and while the `@clickhouse/client` library should pass SETTINGS clauses through to the server, I'm not entirely sure it's working as expected.\n\nBut there's another angle here — the client configuration includes default `clickhouse_settings` like `wait_end_of_query: 1`. These might be interfering with or overriding any inline SETTINGS I'm trying to add to the query itself.\n\nActually, the real problem is that this is a cross-process issue. Each CLI invocation gets its own connection, so when `migrate --execute` finishes in one process and `status` runs in another, they're not sharing the same session. I need to think about whether I can make both operations use the same connection within a single invocation, or find another way to handle the read-after-write consistency between separate processes.\n\nOne approach would be switching to a replicated table engine, but that's complex and environment-specific. Or I could add retry logic to the tests, though that feels like patching the symptom rather than fixing the root cause.\n\nLet me reconsider whether this is actually a consistency issue at all, or if something else is happening — like the ClickHouse Cloud user lacking permissions to create tables in the default database, which would cause `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to silently succeed while the actual table creation fails.\n\nActually, I think I found it: ClickHouse Cloud enables async inserts by default, which means the INSERT returns immediately after buffering the data rather than waiting for it to be written to disk. Even with `wait_end_of_query: 1`, that setting only ensures the query is processed by the server, not that the data is actually persisted — so a subsequent SELECT might not see the data yet. I should try forcing synchronous inserts with `async_insert = 0` to see if that resolves the flakiness. The proper fix for this is to set `async_insert = 0` when inserting into the journal table, OR to use `wait_for_async_insert = 1`.\n\nActually, looking at the ClickHouse docs:\n- `async_insert = 1` enables async inserts (default on ClickHouse Cloud)\n- `wait_for_async_insert = 1` makes the INSERT wait until the data is actually flushed to disk\n\nBut `wait_end_of_query = 1` should also handle this. Let me check...\n\nFrom the ClickHouse docs:\n- `wait_end_of_query` - all results are buffered and sent at once\n- This is about the HTTP protocol, not about async inserts\n\nSo `wait_end_of_query` doesn't help with async inserts. The INSERT returns \"success\" when the data is accepted into the async buffer, but the data isn't yet in the table.\n\nThis is likely the root cause! ClickHouse Cloud has async inserts enabled by default, so `appendEntry` succeeds immediately while the data is still buffering, and then `status` reads before it's actually flushed. I should disable async inserts for the journal operations by setting `async_insert = 0` on those queries, or I could add this setting to the client configuration when creating the journal executor. The challenge is that we're reusing the same executor for both journal and migration operations, so I need to be careful about where to apply this setting. whether disabling async inserts for the journal store would break migrations. Since `db.execute()` handles DDL and DML statements rather than INSERT operations, the `async_insert` setting shouldn't interfere with migration SQL. I could modify `createClickHouseExecutor` to accept an optional settings override, allowing the journal store executor to disable async inserts while keeping the migration executor's settings unchanged.\n\nWriting the INSERT statement with SETTINGS...\n\nActually, I'm realizing `client.command()` won't work for data insertion—I need to use a different method like `client.insert()` or `client.exec()`. Let me instead pass `async_insert: 0` directly to the client settings when creating the journal store executor, so I don't have to handle it at the query level. I'm realizing I need to decide between modifying the shared executor or creating a separate client for the journal store. Option 3—adding `async_insert: 0` directly to `createClickHouseExecutor`—is cleanest since chkit's operations don't benefit from async inserts anyway.

The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: User wants to move migration state from local `journal.json` to ClickHouse itself to support multi-environment deployments (staging/production).\n\n2. **Branch Rename**: System instruction required renaming the branch. Renamed to `marc/migration-state-in-ch`.\n\n3. **Planning Phase**: \n   - Entered plan mode\n   - Launched Explore agent to understand current migration tracking (journal.json in metaDir)\n   - Launched Plan agent to design the ClickHouse-backed journal\n   - Read critical files: migration-store.ts, global-flags.ts, migrate.ts, status.ts, check.ts, clickhouse/index.ts, model-types.ts\n\n4. **User Clarification Questions**:\n   - Where should `_chkit_migrations` table live? → User chose: in the user's configured database\n   - Should CH journal be default? → User said: \"we will remove the journal. so clickhouse is the ONLY option\"\n\n5. **Plan Updated**: Removed local journal entirely, no `--local` flag needed.\n\n6. **User made code changes** (shown in system reminders): The user actually made the code changes themselves based on the plan. The changes appeared in system-reminder notes showing modifications to:\n   - journal-store.ts (new file)\n   - migrate.ts\n   - status.ts\n   - check.ts\n   - migration-store.ts\n   - clickhouse/index.ts\n   - lib.ts\n   - Various test files\n\n7. **PR Creation**: User asked to create a PR. Read PR instructions file. Committed changes, pushed, created PR #46 at https://github.com/obsessiondb/chkit/pull/46\n\n8. **CI Failure**: User attached CI failure logs. 4 tests failed:\n   - `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts:159` - statusPayload.applied expected 1, got 0\n   - `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts:291` - check.exitCode expected 0, got 1\n   - `clickhouse-live.e2e.test.ts:219` - secondPlanPayload.pending.length expected 1, got 2\n   - `drift.e2e.test.ts:308` - checkResult.exitCode expected 0, got 1\n\n9. **First Fix Attempt**: Diagnosed as ClickHouse Cloud SharedMergeTree eventual consistency. Added `SETTINGS select_sequential_consistency = 1` to the readJournal SELECT query. Committed and pushed.\n\n10. **User asked**: \"did we also apply this setting not only for the e2e tests, but also the real journal reads and writes?\" → Confirmed yes, it's in the production journal-store.ts.\n\n11. **User asked**: \"run `bun verify`\" → Ran it locally. Output was truncated. Ran CLI tests separately - 62 pass, 0 fail, 2 errors (missing env vars for live tests, expected locally).\n\n12. **User pointed out**: \"bun verify should use doppler to use real credentials to test everything. Is it not?\" → User was right, `bun verify` uses `doppler run` which provides CH credentials. Re-ran and captured failures - same 4 tests still failing.\n\n13. **Current state**: The `select_sequential_consistency` fix didn't resolve the issue. I was about to investigate the real root cause - likely **async inserts** on ClickHouse Cloud. I had just read the `createClickHouseExecutor` code showing `clickhouse_settings: { wait_end_of_query: 1 }` and was about to add `async_insert: 0` to disable async inserts.\n\nKey files:\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts` - NEW file with JournalStore interface and ClickHouseJournalStore\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/migration-store.ts` - Removed readJournal/writeJournal\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/migrate.ts` - Uses JournalStore, requires CH config\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/status.ts` - Uses JournalStore, requires CH config\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/commands/check.ts` - Uses JournalStore, requires CH config\n- `packages/cli/src/bin/lib.ts` - Updated exports\n- `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` - Added `_chkit_%` exclusion to drift detection\n- Various test files simplified\n\nThe current working hypothesis for the remaining CI failures is that ClickHouse Cloud enables async inserts by default, so INSERT returns \"accepted\" but data isn't yet visible to a subsequent SELECT from a new connection.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants to move migration state tracking from a local `journal.json` file to ClickHouse itself. The motivation is multi-environment support — when deploying to staging first and production later, each ClickHouse instance should independently track which migrations have been applied. The user explicitly stated: \"we will remove the journal. so clickhouse is the ONLY option\" — no local fallback, no `--local` flag.\n\n   Secondary requests:\n   - Create a PR for the changes (PR #46 created at https://github.com/obsessiondb/chkit/pull/46)\n   - Fix failing CI tests (4 live e2e tests failing due to read-after-write visibility on ClickHouse Cloud)\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - ClickHouse `_chkit_migrations` table with `MergeTree()` engine for tracking applied migrations\n   - ClickHouse Cloud's `SharedMergeTree` — automatic conversion from `MergeTree()` on Cloud\n   - `select_sequential_consistency = 1` setting — forces consistent reads on replicated tables\n   - **Async inserts on ClickHouse Cloud** — enabled by default, INSERT returns \"accepted\" but data is buffered, not yet visible to subsequent SELECTs from new connections\n   - `wait_end_of_query: 1` — existing client setting, ensures server processes query before returning (but doesn't help with async insert buffering)\n   - `JournalStore` interface pattern with `readJournal()` and `appendEntry()` methods\n   - Auto-bootstrap pattern: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on first access, with `bootstrapped` flag to avoid redundant DDL\n   - Drift detection exclusion: `AND name NOT LIKE '_chkit_%'` filter in `listSchemaObjects`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`packages/cli/src/bin/journal-store.ts`** (NEW FILE - core of the change)\n     - Contains `JournalStore` interface, `ClickHouseJournalStore` implementation, and factory functions\n     - Creates `_chkit_migrations` table with lazy bootstrapping\n     - Current version includes `select_sequential_consistency = 1` fix (insufficient alone)\n     ```typescript\n     import { createClickHouseExecutor, type ClickHouseExecutor } from '@chkit/clickhouse'\n     import type { ChxConfig } from '@chkit/core'\n     import type { MigrationJournal, MigrationJournalEntry } from './migration-store.js'\n     import { CLI_VERSION } from './version.js'\n\n     export interface JournalStore {\n       readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal>\n       appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void>\n     }\n\n     const CREATE_TABLE_SQL = `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _chkit_migrations (\n         name String,\n         applied_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),\n         checksum String,\n         chkit_version String\n     ) ENGINE = MergeTree()\n     ORDER BY (name)\n     SETTINGS index_granularity = 1`\n\n     interface MigrationRow extends Record<string, unknown> {\n       name: string\n       applied_at: string\n       checksum: string\n       chkit_version: string\n     }\n\n     export function createJournalStore(db: ClickHouseExecutor): JournalStore {\n       let bootstrapped = false\n\n       async function ensureTable(): Promise<void> {\n         if (bootstrapped) return\n         await db.execute(CREATE_TABLE_SQL)\n         bootstrapped = true\n       }\n\n       return {\n         async readJournal(): Promise<MigrationJournal> {\n           await ensureTable()\n           const rows = await db.query<MigrationRow>(\n             `SELECT name, applied_at, checksum, chkit_version FROM _chkit_migrations ORDER BY name SETTINGS select_sequential_consistency = 1`\n           )\n           return {\n             version: 1,\n             applied: rows.map((row) => ({\n               name: row.name,\n               appliedAt: row.applied_at,\n               checksum: row.checksum,\n             })),\n           }\n         },\n\n         async appendEntry(entry: MigrationJournalEntry): Promise<void> {\n           await ensureTable()\n           await db.insert<MigrationRow>({\n             table: '_chkit_migrations',\n             values: [\n               {\n                 name: entry.name,\n                 applied_at: entry.appliedAt,\n                 checksum: entry.checksum,\n                 chkit_version: CLI_VERSION,\n               },\n             ],\n           })\n         },\n       }\n     }\n\n     export function createJournalStoreFromConfig(\n       clickhouseConfig: NonNullable<ChxConfig['clickhouse']>\n     ): { journalStore: JournalStore;

Errors and Fixes:\n   - **CI failure: 4 live e2e tests failing** (journal entries not visible to subsequent CLI commands):\n     - Root cause hypothesis 1: SharedMergeTree eventual consistency on ClickHouse Cloud\n     - Fix attempt 1: Added `SETTINGS select_sequential_consistency = 1` to readJournal SELECT query\n     - Result: **DID NOT FIX** — same 4 tests still fail when running `bun verify` with real credentials\n     - Root cause hypothesis 2 (current): **ClickHouse Cloud enables async inserts by default**. The `INSERT` via `appendEntry` returns \"accepted\" but data is only buffered, not yet written to the table. A subsequent `SELECT` from a NEW connection (new CLI subprocess) doesn't see the data.\n     - Planned fix: Add `async_insert: 0` to `clickhouse_settings` in `createClickHouseExecutor`\n   \n   - **User feedback**: User pointed out that `bun verify` uses `doppler run` with real ClickHouse credentials, so the live e2e tests DO run locally — I initially thought they only ran in CI.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Solved**: Designed and implemented ClickHouse-backed migration journal (plan + code changes)\n   - **Solved**: Created PR #46\n   - **Ongoing**: 4 live e2e tests failing due to read-after-write visibility on ClickHouse Cloud. First fix (`select_sequential_consistency`) was insufficient. Next fix needed: disable async inserts via `async_insert: 0` in client settings.\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"Currently we are storing the state of whether the migrations have been applied in the repository. Unfortunately this doesn't work if we need to run against different environments where, for example, it's first applied to staging and then later to production. So I think we need to change the script to store which migrations have been applied and when in ClickHouse itself. So think about what this would mean and how we could do it.\"\n   - Answer to Q1: \"In the user's configured database (config.clickhouse.database) — simplest, no extra CREATE DATABASE needed\"\n   - Answer to Q2: \"we will remove the journal. so clickhouse is the ONLY option\"\n   - \"Create a PR\" (with attached PR instructions file)\n   - \"Fix the failing CI actions. I've attached the failure logs.\" (with attached verify log)\n   - \"did we also apply this setting not only for the e2e tests, but also the real journal reads and writes?\"\n   - \"run `bun verify`\"\n   - \"bun `verify` should use doppler to use real credentials to test everything. Is it not?\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Fix the 4 remaining live e2e test failures by addressing the async insert issue on ClickHouse Cloud\n   - Push the fix and verify CI passes\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Actively debugging why 4 live e2e tests still fail after the `select_sequential_consistency` fix. The same 4 tests fail both in CI and locally with `bun verify` (which uses doppler for real ClickHouse Cloud credentials). I had just read `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts` lines 131-140 showing `clickhouse_settings: { wait_end_of_query: 1 }` and was about to add `async_insert: 0` to disable ClickHouse Cloud's default async insert behavior, which buffers INSERT data rather than writing it synchronously.\n\n   The user's last message was: \"bun `verify` should use doppler to use real credentials to test everything. Is it not?\" — confirming that `bun verify` does test with real CH Cloud and the failures are reproducible locally.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Add `async_insert: 0` to the `clickhouse_settings` in `createClickHouseExecutor` at `packages/clickhouse/src/index.ts:137-139` to disable ClickHouse Cloud's default async insert buffering, ensuring journal INSERTs are immediately visible to subsequent SELECTs. This directly addresses the 4 failing live e2e tests. The edit would change:\n   ```typescript\n   clickhouse_settings: {\n     wait_end_of_query: 1,\n   },\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```typescript\n   clickhouse_settings: {\n     wait_end_of_query: 1,\n     async_insert: 0,\n   },\n   ```\n   Then re-run `bun verify` to confirm the fix, commit, and push.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/marc/.REDACTED.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

The drift tests that were passing before now fail, and the clickhouse-live test has a different error. The issue is that by changing `database: 'default'` to `database: '${database}'`, the ClickHouse client now connects to the test-specific database. But the `_chkit_migrations` table is being created IN that database, so when the test tries to run `migrate --json` (plan mode, not execute), the CLI tries to connect to the test database but the `_chkit_migrations` table creation happens there too. Let me look at the actual error more carefully.\n\nThe clickhouse-live test failure is at line 132:\n\n\nThe plan mode command is exiting with code 1 instead of 0, so something's going wrong during the migration planning phase. I need to check what stderr the failing command is producing to understand what's actually breaking.\n\nLooking at the test setup, the database in the config is now test-specific, and the `_chkit_migrations` table should be created in that same database when `ensureTable()` runs. The migration SQL itself uses explicit database references, so that part should work regardless of which database the client is connected to.\n\nBut I'm wondering if the `migrate --json` failure is actually something different. Let me trace through what happens: `init` creates the chkit directory, `generate` creates a migration using the test database config, then `migrate --json` tries to run in plan mode. The issue could be that when `migrate` creates the journal store executor, it's connecting to the test database to ensure the migrations table exists, but maybe that database hasn't been properly set up yet or there's a connection issue I'm not seeing.\n\nLooking at the drift test failures, they were passing before I changed the fixture database config and the inline configs, so the problem is likely related to how the test database is being referenced in the migrations themselves. The migrations might be trying to reference tables like `chkit_e2e_12345.users` in the test database, and when the CLI connects to that same database, something breaks. Let me check the actual error output from the clickhouse-live test to understand what's happening. It's the first test \"runs init + generate + migrate + status against live ClickHouse\" at line 132. The `migrate --json` plan command is failing with exit code 1. Let me add some debug output.\n\nWait, actually let me re-read the test. The issue might be that `init` command now errors because it detects a ClickHouse config but can't connect... no, `init` just creates files.\n\nLet me think about what might have changed. I changed the clickhouse config to use the test database instead of 'default'. The migrate command now creates a journal store connecting to the test database. The `ensureTable()` creates `_chkit_migrations` in the test database. The migration SQL itself references `database.table` explicitly. So the plan mode should work fine.\n\nBut wait - the `migrate` command reads the journal, then reads the migrations, then computes pending.

Here's a summary of the three issues fixed:\n\n1. **DateTime64 parsing error** — `new Date().toISOString()` produces timestamps ending with `Z`, but ClickHouse's `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')` can't parse that via JSONEachRow. Fixed by stripping the `Z` suffix.\n\n2. **Async insert buffering** — ClickHouse Cloud enables async inserts by default, so INSERT returns before data is visible. Added `async_insert: 0` to client settings to ensure synchronous inserts.\n\n3. **Test isolation** — E2e tests used `database: 'default'` for the config, sharing a single `_chkit_migrations` table across all test runs. Changed to use per-test databases so each test gets its own journal table. Also added `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS` to the drift test fixture."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":208,"cache_read_input_tokens":66743,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":208},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYSWKzuNrzi4jcg6WgabU","type":"assistant","uuid":"f22e1e8e-d077-4b6a-99d0-b9d9da0750fc","timestamp":"2026-02-24T07:33:44.661Z"}
