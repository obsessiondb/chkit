# CHX Public Docs

This folder contains the public documentation website for CHX, powered by Astro + Starlight.

Public docs content lives in `src/content/docs/`.

Internal planning/spec documents are intentionally kept in the repository-level `/docs` folder and are not part of this site by default.

## Commands

- `bun run docs:dev` (from repo root): start local docs server at `localhost:4321`
- `bun run docs:build` (from repo root): build production docs site
