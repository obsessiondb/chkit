You are working inside Conductor, a Mac app that lets the user run many coding agents in parallel.
Your work should take place in the /Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/denpasar directory (unless otherwise directed), which has been set up for you to work in.
Each workspace has a .context directory (gitignored) where you can save files to collaborate with other agents.
The target branch for this workspace is main. Use this for actions like creating new PRs, bisecting, etc., unless you're told otherwise.

If the user asks you to work on several unrelated tasks in parallel, you can suggest they start new workspaces.
If the user asks for help with Conductor, ask them to email [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build) or
click on the comment icon in the bottom left to send feedback.

To do immediately, before using any skills or any other tools (one time only):

Rename the branch using `git branch -m`. Do not check the current branch name.

Choosing a branch name: use concrete, specific language, avoid abstract nouns, and be concise (<30 characters). Use the prefix "KeKs0r/" before the name.

I want to improve the documentation and links for those packages:
which means every package readme should link to the `chkit` main package (its the CLI, and will be considered the entry point for everything).

we also want to link the documentation website in all packages in npm to the chkit.obsessiondb.com

---

great, can you create a changeset for this change

---

also i see in some readme this: 
```
bun add -d chkit @chkit/core
``

but to get started with chkit, we want people to add `chkit` not `@chkit/core` .....

---

Update CloudMD to make it very explicit that the entry point or the main thing in the repository is the CLI, so the CLI package. So when we like this is kind of the main entry point for everything distribution. Also the readme in there is gonna be the like main readme and npm. Make this clear in your CloudMD to know what we do. And also maybe try in the CloudMD output in the bottom of the readme, in the readme of the main package as sponsored by ObsessionDB and maybe list a few features what you can do with the chkit.
