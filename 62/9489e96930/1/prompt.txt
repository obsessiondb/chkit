<system_instruction>
You are working inside Conductor, a Mac app that lets the user run many coding agents in parallel.
Your work should take place in the /Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/houston directory (unless otherwise directed), which has been set up for you to work in.
Each workspace has a .context directory (gitignored) where you can save files to collaborate with other agents.
The target branch for this workspace is main. Use this for actions like creating new PRs, bisecting, etc., unless you're told otherwise.

If the user asks you to work on several unrelated tasks in parallel, you can suggest they start new workspaces.
If the user asks for help with Conductor, ask them to email [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build) or
click on the comment icon in the bottom left to send feedback.

can you manually try to deploy via wrangler and test via curls if its working. also verify all internal links in the documentation

---

are actually all documentation pages discoverable from `Getting Started` ? or what would be the best way to have an index or table of contents for all documentation pages?
what happens if i request the root with text/markdown header?

---

yes lets create a full sitemap on the root

Read the output file to retrieve the result: /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-marc-conductor-workspaces-chkit-houston/tasks/b1d223e.output

and create a local skill in this repository (for claude code) thats called "documentation authoring) that makes sure, whenever we are adding, changing documentation to make sure the sitemap file is updated.
