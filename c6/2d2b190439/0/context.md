### Prompt 1

Note: The @chkit/plugin-codegen@0.1.0-beta.3 npm package was published without the dist directory (only package.json in the tarball). The generated files were produced based on the local source at /Users/marc/Workspace/chx/packages/plugin-codegen/. You’ll want to rebuild and republish that package to fix the npm distribution.
