You are working inside Conductor, a Mac app that lets the user run many coding agents in parallel.
Your work should take place in the /Users/marc/conductor/workspaces/chkit/davao directory (unless otherwise directed), which has been set up for you to work in.
Each workspace has a .context directory (gitignored) where you can save files to collaborate with other agents.
The target branch for this workspace is rename-chkit. Use this for actions like creating new PRs, bisecting, etc., unless you're told otherwise.

If the user asks you to work on several unrelated tasks in parallel, you can suggest they start new workspaces.
If the user asks for help with Conductor, ask them to email [humans@conductor.build](mailto:humans@conductor.build) or
click on the comment icon in the bottom left to send feedback.

Go over all features of the CLI, and double check if they are part of our current documentation,  also brainstorm, what other things could help users to adapt this CLI and how to use it. 
And since this is a project also to promote our hosted clickhouse service. Do you have ideas on how to integrate some promotion of it?
Only analyse think and brianstorm and present me with ideas, improvement options, missing documentation etc... and then we go through them individually

work on all of these, to create the according implementation plans in a subagent

1. yes we do need this heavily write a plan for this to let me work on it in extra session
2. yes agreed, also create a plan, but we dont have a backfill plugin yet, pull plugin is needed, but backfill does not exist yet, or does it. create a plan.
3. agreed, but lets do this when we are finished, but feel free to create a plan afor it already
4. yes for the main commands definately how should we handle plugin commands?
5. create a plan, but we will only work on this afterwards.
6. also create a plan for it with your ideas
