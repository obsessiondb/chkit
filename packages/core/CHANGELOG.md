# @chkit/core

## 0.1.2-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 5a8d805: Support ClickHouse function expressions in `primaryKey`/`orderBy` (e.g. `toDate(ts)`, `toStartOfHour(session_end)`). Validation no longer reports `primary_key_missing_column`/`order_by_missing_column` for expression entries, and generated DDL emits them verbatim instead of quoting the whole expression as a column name. Plain column references are still validated and backtick-quoted as before.

  Migration planning now compares key clauses independent of insignificant whitespace and identifier backtick-quoting, so an expression written as `toStartOfHour( ts )` or a column written bare as `user-id` no longer diffs against ClickHouse's normalized `toStartOfHour(ts)` / `` `user-id` `` and triggers a phantom table recreate on `migrate`/`drift`/`check`.

- b501f5d: Extract shared plugin command scaffolding into `@chkit/core`: new `createPluginRunner` (binds a plugin's config-error class once and wraps command `run` handlers in the shared error-to-exit-code envelope) and `withFactoryDefaults` (layers plugin-factory options under parsed data). The backfill, codegen, and pull plugins now use these helpers instead of private copies — no behavior change, but the plugins require the matching `@chkit/core` version.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 6b87e6d: Add ClickHouse cluster support. Set `clickhouse.cluster` in your config to run all generated DDL `ON CLUSTER <name>` and store the migration journal in a replicated engine — for self-managed multi-node clusters. Your table engines are passed through unchanged (declare `ReplicatedMergeTree` yourself). Leave `cluster` unset for single-node, ClickHouse Cloud, or ObsessionDB, where replication is automatic and `ON CLUSTER` is unnecessary.

## 0.1.0

### Patch Changes

- c63c74f: Add `emitMigrations` option to the codegen plugin. When enabled, generates a self-contained TypeScript module with all migration SQL inlined and a `runMigrations()` function for environments without filesystem access (e.g., Cloudflare Workers). Also extracts `splitSqlStatements` and `extractExecutableStatements` into `@chkit/core` as shared utilities.
- ba60638: Add homepage and repository metadata to all packages, and link READMEs to the chkit CLI package and documentation site.
- c396fb5: Generated migration modules now import `extractExecutableStatements` from `@chkit/core/utils` instead of inlining the sql-splitter source. Adds a `./utils` sub-path export to `@chkit/core`.
- 1a5caa3: Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
- a94a2a1: Replace @stricli/core with a custom CLI framework, migrate plugins to declared flags, and refine the plugin API and error handling.
- ff1cd31: Stop reporting unmanaged tables as drift by default. On a shared database, every object chkit doesn't manage was emitted as `extra_object` and set `drifted = true`, so `drift` always reported drift and `check` (which defaults to `failOnDrift: true`) failed the CI gate permanently for unrelated reasons. Objects that exist in ClickHouse but are not in your schema are now reported for visibility but no longer count as drift. A new `check.failOnExtraObjects` option (default `false`) opts back into treating them as drift, for when chkit owns the entire database.
- d9d5038: Polish error messages and a few noisy outputs:

  - A table defined with `orderBy` but no `primaryKey` no longer crashes with a raw `TypeError`; the primary key defaults to the order-by columns, matching ClickHouse.
  - Built-in command errors (e.g. a rejected migration) surface their own clean message instead of being wrapped in `Plugin "core" failed in ...`.
  - `chkit query` syntax errors no longer leak the injected `FORMAT JSON` clause the user never typed, and the "Expected one of" token dump is capped.
  - Connection errors whose reason is only in the message (no `.code`) — e.g. a typo'd host — are now recognized and cleaned instead of leaking the raw client string.
  - The post-apply message names the resolved journal table (respecting `CHKIT_JOURNAL_TABLE`) instead of a hardcoded `_chkit_migrations`.
  - The ObsessionDB "authenticated but no service selected" reminder is suppressed when a direct `clickhouse` target is configured (it was layered in from a global login, not chosen for the project).

- a94a2a1: Fix migration ordering so tables are created before views and materialized views that depend on them.
- cc1125e: Fix parameterized skip index type rendering. ClickHouse requires `set` indexes to have a size argument (e.g., `set(0)` for unlimited). Add optional `typeArgs` field to `SkipIndexDefinition` to support parameterized index types (`set`, `bloom_filter`, `tokenbf_v1`, `ngrambf_v1`) and parse type arguments from introspected schemas.
- f719c50: Fix workspace:\* dependencies in published packages. Restores manual workspace version resolution before publish due to a bun publish bug (oven-sh/bun#24687) where workspace:\* references are not resolved in the published tarball.
- 8d5878a: Generate idempotent `RENAME COLUMN` / `RENAME TABLE` statements using `IF EXISTS`. Renames are the one non-idempotent generated DDL: replaying `RENAME COLUMN a TO b` after it already ran fails with "unknown identifier". With `IF EXISTS`, a replay after a partial migration failure (or alongside per-statement resume) is a safe no-op instead of bricking the migration. Applies to both auto-detected rename suggestions and explicit `--rename-column` / `--rename-table` / `renamedFrom` renames.
- a94a2a1: Move flag parsing and shared types to @chkit/core, split plugin-codegen into focused modules, and resolve lint warnings.
- bc0c6b1: Fix materialized view drop operations on managed ClickHouse environments (e.g. ObsessionDB) by using `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` instead of `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`. This ensures metadata removal is fully propagated before subsequent column drop operations execute, preventing "column is referenced by materialized view" errors.
- 5ee4afc: Order materialized-view creates by their `refresh.dependsOn` edges. Creates within the same kind were tie-broken purely by name, so a refreshable materialized view declared `DEPENDS ON other_mv` whose name sorted before its dependency could be created first and fail. The planner now creates a `DEPENDS ON` target before the view that depends on it; independent views keep their stable alphabetical order.
- 9a54433: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md governance documents, .env.example for development setup, and update package.json metadata for all packages.
- b0f200d: Add support for per-column compression codecs.

  Declare a codec directly on a column with a structured discriminated union:

  ```ts
  import { codec, table } from "@chkit/core";

  const events = table({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "events",
    columns: [
      { name: "id", type: "UInt64" },
      { name: "ts", type: "DateTime", codec: { kind: "ZSTD", level: 3 } },
      {
        name: "delta",
        type: "Int64",
        codec: [{ kind: "Delta", size: 4 }, { kind: "ZSTD" }],
      },
      { name: "exp", type: "Float32", codec: codec.raw("SomeNewCodec(42)") },
    ],
    engine: "MergeTree()",
    primaryKey: ["id"],
    orderBy: ["id"],
  });
  ```

  Highlights:

  - `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD/MODIFY COLUMN` emit the `CODEC(...)` clause in the correct position (after `DEFAULT` and `COMMENT`, as required by ClickHouse).
  - `chkit generate` emits `MODIFY COLUMN ... REMOVE CODEC` when a codec is dropped and no other column fields change; otherwise a single `MODIFY COLUMN` replaces the codec.
  - `chkit pull` introspects `system.columns.compression_codec` and renders structured codec objects back into the schema file. Unknown codec tokens fall back to `codec.raw(...)` so new ClickHouse codecs still round-trip.
  - Canonicalization fills ClickHouse defaults (`ZSTD` → level 1, `LZ4HC` → level 9, `Delta`/`DoubleDelta`/`Gorilla` → size 1), so `{kind:'ZSTD'}` and `{kind:'ZSTD', level:1}` compare equal and the diff engine stays stable across pull → plan round-trips.
  - Validation catches codec chains with more than one general codec, chains that do not end with a general codec, or an empty chain (`codec: []`) — preprocessor alone is accepted since ClickHouse auto-appends the default general codec.
  - `parseCodec` falls back to `raw` when a known codec token has unexpected extra args (e.g. `ZSTD(3, 1)`), so future ClickHouse codec extensions round-trip cleanly through `chkit pull` instead of silently dropping arguments.

- a77c5b2: Add support for ClickHouse refreshable materialized views (RMVs), GA since ClickHouse 24.10.

  Define a refreshable MV by adding a `refresh` field to `materializedView()`:

  ```ts
  const dailyReport = materializedView({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "daily_report_mv",
    to: { database: "analytics", name: "daily_report" },
    refresh: { every: "1 DAY", offset: "2 HOUR" },
    as: "SELECT toDate(ts) AS day, count() AS total FROM analytics.events GROUP BY day",
  });
  ```

  Supported fields: `every`, `after`, `offset`, `randomize`, `dependsOn`, `settings`, `append`, `empty`.

  Highlights:

  - `chkit generate` emits `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY REFRESH` for schedule-only changes and `DROP ... SYNC` + `CREATE` for structural changes (added/removed refresh, toggled APPEND).
  - `chkit pull` parses the REFRESH clause from `system.tables.create_table_query` and ignores the `DEFINER` / `SQL SECURITY` clauses that managed ClickHouse environments auto-inject.
  - Validation catches: missing/both `every`/`after`, invalid interval formats, non-APPEND RMV pointing at a replicated (`SharedMergeTree` / `Replicated*`) target (ClickHouse rejects this), and `DEPENDS ON` paired with `REFRESH AFTER`.

  See the [Refreshable materialized views docs](https://chkit.obsessiondb.com/schema/refreshable-views/) for the full reference.

- a3a09cf: Rename plugin-typegen to plugin-codegen and add ingestion functions.
- d983fdf: Rename internals and CLI binary from chkit to chkit.
- b0f200d: **Breaking:** Skip indexes now use a structured discriminated union instead of a free-form `typeArgs: string` field. Each index `type` has its own typed fields, which moves argument validation from runtime to the type system.

  ```ts
  indexes: [
    // before
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      typeArgs: "0",
      granularity: 1,
    },
    // after
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      maxRows: 0,
      granularity: 1,
    },
  ];
  ```

  | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `type: 'minmax'`                               | `type: 'minmax'`                                                                    |

  | `type: 'bloom_filter'`                         | `type: 'bloom_filter'`                                                              |
  | `type: 'bloom_filter', typeArgs: '0.01'`       | `type: 'bloom_filter', falsePositiveRate: 0.01`                                     |
  | `type: 'tokenbf_v1', typeArgs: '32768, 3, 0'`  | `type: 'tokenbf_v1', sizeBytes: 32768, hashFunctions: 3, randomSeed: 0`             |
  | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', typeArgs: '3, 256, 2, 0'` | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', ngramSize: 3, sizeBytes: 256, hashFunctions: 2, randomSeed: 0` |

  Highlights:

  - `set` now requires `maxRows` at the type level — forgetting it is a TypeScript error rather than a runtime validation failure.
  - `tokenbf_v1` and `ngrambf_v1` have typed `sizeBytes`, `hashFunctions`, `randomSeed` (and `ngramSize` for ngram), so positional argument mistakes are caught at compile time.
  - `bloom_filter` keeps `falsePositiveRate` optional — omit it to emit a bare `bloom_filter` clause.
  - `chkit pull` now introspects `system.data_skipping_indices.type_full` and emits the structured fields back into schema files; unknown types still round-trip via the existing path.
  - The `index_type_missing_args` validation code is removed since it is now a compile-time concern.

- 0aa2c28: Load `.ts` config and schema files under plain Node, not only Bun. Previously every database command (`status`, `generate`, `migrate`, `check`, `drift`, `query`) failed on Node with `Unknown file extension ".ts"`, despite the docs advertising Node.js 20+. Config and schema modules now load through jiti on Node (and continue to use Bun's native importer under Bun). Also improves the cold-start error when a config can't resolve its dependencies: instead of a raw module-resolution error, chkit now reports which package is missing and tells you to run `bun install` (or `npm`/`pnpm install`).
- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.

  - `tokenbf_v1` and `ngrambf_v1` have typed `sizeBytes`, `hashFunctions`, `randomSeed` (and `ngramSize` for ngram), so positional argument mistakes are caught at compile time.
  - `bloom_filter` keeps `falsePositiveRate` optional — omit it to emit a bare `bloom_filter` clause.
  - `chkit pull` now introspects `system.data_skipping_indices.type_full` and emits the structured fields back into schema files; unknown types still round-trip via the existing path.
  - The `index_type_missing_args` validation code is removed since it is now a compile-time concern.

- 0aa2c28: Load `.ts` config and schema files under plain Node, not only Bun. Previously every database command (`status`, `generate`, `migrate`, `check`, `drift`, `query`) failed on Node with `Unknown file extension ".ts"`, despite the docs advertising Node.js 20+. Config and schema modules now load through jiti on Node (and continue to use Bun's native importer under Bun). Also improves the cold-start error when a config can't resolve its dependencies: instead of a raw module-resolution error, chkit now reports which package is missing and tells you to run `bun install` (or `npm`/`pnpm install`).
- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.

## 0.1.0-beta.28

### Patch Changes

- c63c74f: Add `emitMigrations` option to the codegen plugin. When enabled, generates a self-contained TypeScript module with all migration SQL inlined and a `runMigrations()` function for environments without filesystem access (e.g., Cloudflare Workers). Also extracts `splitSqlStatements` and `extractExecutableStatements` into `@chkit/core` as shared utilities.
- ba60638: Add homepage and repository metadata to all packages, and link READMEs to the chkit CLI package and documentation site.
- c396fb5: Generated migration modules now import `extractExecutableStatements` from `@chkit/core/utils` instead of inlining the sql-splitter source. Adds a `./utils` sub-path export to `@chkit/core`.
- 1a5caa3: Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
- a94a2a1: Replace @stricli/core with a custom CLI framework, migrate plugins to declared flags, and refine the plugin API and error handling.
- a94a2a1: Fix migration ordering so tables are created before views and materialized views that depend on them.
- cc1125e: Fix parameterized skip index type rendering. ClickHouse requires `set` indexes to have a size argument (e.g., `set(0)` for unlimited). Add optional `typeArgs` field to `SkipIndexDefinition` to support parameterized index types (`set`, `bloom_filter`, `tokenbf_v1`, `ngrambf_v1`) and parse type arguments from introspected schemas.
- f719c50: Fix workspace:\* dependencies in published packages. Restores manual workspace version resolution before publish due to a bun publish bug (oven-sh/bun#24687) where workspace:\* references are not resolved in the published tarball.
- a94a2a1: Move flag parsing and shared types to @chkit/core, split plugin-codegen into focused modules, and resolve lint warnings.
- bc0c6b1: Fix materialized view drop operations on managed ClickHouse environments (e.g. ObsessionDB) by using `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` instead of `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`. This ensures metadata removal is fully propagated before subsequent column drop operations execute, preventing "column is referenced by materialized view" errors.
- 9a54433: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md governance documents, .env.example for development setup, and update package.json metadata for all packages.
- b0f200d: Add support for per-column compression codecs.

  Declare a codec directly on a column with a structured discriminated union:

  ```ts
  import { codec, table } from "@chkit/core";

  const events = table({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "events",
    columns: [
      { name: "id", type: "UInt64" },
      { name: "ts", type: "DateTime", codec: { kind: "ZSTD", level: 3 } },
      {
        name: "delta",
        type: "Int64",
        codec: [{ kind: "Delta", size: 4 }, { kind: "ZSTD" }],
      },
      { name: "exp", type: "Float32", codec: codec.raw("SomeNewCodec(42)") },
    ],
    engine: "MergeTree()",
    primaryKey: ["id"],
    orderBy: ["id"],
  });
  ```

  Highlights:

  - `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD/MODIFY COLUMN` emit the `CODEC(...)` clause in the correct position (after `DEFAULT` and `COMMENT`, as required by ClickHouse).
  - `chkit generate` emits `MODIFY COLUMN ... REMOVE CODEC` when a codec is dropped and no other column fields change; otherwise a single `MODIFY COLUMN` replaces the codec.
  - `chkit pull` introspects `system.columns.compression_codec` and renders structured codec objects back into the schema file. Unknown codec tokens fall back to `codec.raw(...)` so new ClickHouse codecs still round-trip.
  - Canonicalization fills ClickHouse defaults (`ZSTD` → level 1, `LZ4HC` → level 9, `Delta`/`DoubleDelta`/`Gorilla` → size 1), so `{kind:'ZSTD'}` and `{kind:'ZSTD', level:1}` compare equal and the diff engine stays stable across pull → plan round-trips.
  - Validation catches codec chains with more than one general codec, chains that do not end with a general codec, or an empty chain (`codec: []`) — preprocessor alone is accepted since ClickHouse auto-appends the default general codec.
  - `parseCodec` falls back to `raw` when a known codec token has unexpected extra args (e.g. `ZSTD(3, 1)`), so future ClickHouse codec extensions round-trip cleanly through `chkit pull` instead of silently dropping arguments.

- a77c5b2: Add support for ClickHouse refreshable materialized views (RMVs), GA since ClickHouse 24.10.

  Define a refreshable MV by adding a `refresh` field to `materializedView()`:

  ```ts
  const dailyReport = materializedView({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "daily_report_mv",
    to: { database: "analytics", name: "daily_report" },
    refresh: { every: "1 DAY", offset: "2 HOUR" },
    as: "SELECT toDate(ts) AS day, count() AS total FROM analytics.events GROUP BY day",
  });
  ```

  Supported fields: `every`, `after`, `offset`, `randomize`, `dependsOn`, `settings`, `append`, `empty`.

  Highlights:

  - `chkit generate` emits `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY REFRESH` for schedule-only changes and `DROP ... SYNC` + `CREATE` for structural changes (added/removed refresh, toggled APPEND).
  - `chkit pull` parses the REFRESH clause from `system.tables.create_table_query` and ignores the `DEFINER` / `SQL SECURITY` clauses that managed ClickHouse environments auto-inject.
  - Validation catches: missing/both `every`/`after`, invalid interval formats, non-APPEND RMV pointing at a replicated (`SharedMergeTree` / `Replicated*`) target (ClickHouse rejects this), and `DEPENDS ON` paired with `REFRESH AFTER`.

  See the [Refreshable materialized views docs](https://chkit.obsessiondb.com/schema/refreshable-views/) for the full reference.

- a3a09cf: Rename plugin-typegen to plugin-codegen and add ingestion functions.
- d983fdf: Rename internals and CLI binary from chkit to chkit.
- b0f200d: **Breaking:** Skip indexes now use a structured discriminated union instead of a free-form `typeArgs: string` field. Each index `type` has its own typed fields, which moves argument validation from runtime to the type system.

  ```ts
  indexes: [
    // before
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      typeArgs: "0",
      granularity: 1,
    },
    // after
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      maxRows: 0,
      granularity: 1,
    },
  ];
  ```

  | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', typeArgs: '3, 256, 2, 0'` | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', ngramSize: 3, sizeBytes: 256, hashFunctions: 2, randomSeed: 0` |

  Highlights:

  - `set` now requires `maxRows` at the type level — forgetting it is a TypeScript error rather than a runtime validation failure.

  - `chkit pull` parses the REFRESH clause from `system.tables.create_table_query` and ignores the `DEFINER` / `SQL SECURITY` clauses that managed ClickHouse environments auto-inject.
  - Validation catches: missing/both `every`/`after`, invalid interval formats, non-APPEND RMV pointing at a replicated (`SharedMergeTree` / `Replicated*`) target (ClickHouse rejects this), and `DEPENDS ON` paired with `REFRESH AFTER`.

  Highlights:

  - `set` now requires `maxRows` at the type level — forgetting it is a TypeScript error rather than a runtime validation failure.
  - `tokenbf_v1` and `ngrambf_v1` have typed `sizeBytes`, `hashFunctions`, `randomSeed` (and `ngramSize` for ngram), so positional argument mistakes are caught at compile time.
  - `bloom_filter` keeps `falsePositiveRate` optional — omit it to emit a bare `bloom_filter` clause.
  - `chkit pull` now introspects `system.data_skipping_indices.type_full` and emits the structured fields back into schema files; unknown types still round-trip via the existing path.
  - The `index_type_missing_args` validation code is removed since it is now a compile-time concern.

- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.

## 0.1.0-beta.25

### Patch Changes

- c63c74f: Add `emitMigrations` option to the codegen plugin. When enabled, generates a self-contained TypeScript module with all migration SQL inlined and a `runMigrations()` function for environments without filesystem access (e.g., Cloudflare Workers). Also extracts `splitSqlStatements` and `extractExecutableStatements` into `@chkit/core` as shared utilities.
- ba60638: Add homepage and repository metadata to all packages, and link READMEs to the chkit CLI package and documentation site.
- c396fb5: Generated migration modules now import `extractExecutableStatements` from `@chkit/core/utils` instead of inlining the sql-splitter source. Adds a `./utils` sub-path export to `@chkit/core`.
- 1a5caa3: Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
- a94a2a1: Replace @stricli/core with a custom CLI framework, migrate plugins to declared flags, and refine the plugin API and error handling.
- a94a2a1: Fix migration ordering so tables are created before views and materialized views that depend on them.
- cc1125e: Fix parameterized skip index type rendering. ClickHouse requires `set` indexes to have a size argument (e.g., `set(0)` for unlimited). Add optional `typeArgs` field to `SkipIndexDefinition` to support parameterized index types (`set`, `bloom_filter`, `tokenbf_v1`, `ngrambf_v1`) and parse type arguments from introspected schemas.
- f719c50: Fix workspace:\* dependencies in published packages. Restores manual workspace version resolution before publish due to a bun publish bug (oven-sh/bun#24687) where workspace:\* references are not resolved in the published tarball.
- a94a2a1: Move flag parsing and shared types to @chkit/core, split plugin-codegen into focused modules, and resolve lint warnings.
- bc0c6b1: Fix materialized view drop operations on managed ClickHouse environments (e.g. ObsessionDB) by using `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` instead of `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`. This ensures metadata removal is fully propagated before subsequent column drop operations execute, preventing "column is referenced by materialized view" errors.
- 9a54433: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md governance documents, .env.example for development setup, and update package.json metadata for all packages.
- b0f200d: Add support for per-column compression codecs.

  Declare a codec directly on a column with a structured discriminated union:

  ```ts
  import { codec, table } from "@chkit/core";

  const events = table({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "events",
    columns: [
      { name: "id", type: "UInt64" },
      { name: "ts", type: "DateTime", codec: { kind: "ZSTD", level: 3 } },
      {
        name: "delta",
        type: "Int64",
        codec: [{ kind: "Delta", size: 4 }, { kind: "ZSTD" }],
      },
      { name: "exp", type: "Float32", codec: codec.raw("SomeNewCodec(42)") },
    ],
    engine: "MergeTree()",
    primaryKey: ["id"],
    orderBy: ["id"],
  });
  ```

  Highlights:

  - `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD/MODIFY COLUMN` emit the `CODEC(...)` clause in the correct position (after `DEFAULT` and `COMMENT`, as required by ClickHouse).
  - `chkit generate` emits `MODIFY COLUMN ... REMOVE CODEC` when a codec is dropped and no other column fields change; otherwise a single `MODIFY COLUMN` replaces the codec.
  - `chkit pull` introspects `system.columns.compression_codec` and renders structured codec objects back into the schema file. Unknown codec tokens fall back to `codec.raw(...)` so new ClickHouse codecs still round-trip.
  - Canonicalization fills ClickHouse defaults (`ZSTD` → level 1, `LZ4HC` → level 9, `Delta`/`DoubleDelta`/`Gorilla` → size 1), so `{kind:'ZSTD'}` and `{kind:'ZSTD', level:1}` compare equal and the diff engine stays stable across pull → plan round-trips.
  - Validation catches codec chains with more than one general codec, chains that do not end with a general codec, or an empty chain (`codec: []`) — preprocessor alone is accepted since ClickHouse auto-appends the default general codec.
  - `parseCodec` falls back to `raw` when a known codec token has unexpected extra args (e.g. `ZSTD(3, 1)`), so future ClickHouse codec extensions round-trip cleanly through `chkit pull` instead of silently dropping arguments.

- a77c5b2: Add support for ClickHouse refreshable materialized views (RMVs), GA since ClickHouse 24.10.

  Define a refreshable MV by adding a `refresh` field to `materializedView()`:

  ```ts
  const dailyReport = materializedView({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "daily_report_mv",
    to: { database: "analytics", name: "daily_report" },
    refresh: { every: "1 DAY", offset: "2 HOUR" },
    as: "SELECT toDate(ts) AS day, count() AS total FROM analytics.events GROUP BY day",
  });
  ```

  Supported fields: `every`, `after`, `offset`, `randomize`, `dependsOn`, `settings`, `append`, `empty`.

  Highlights:

  - `chkit generate` emits `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY REFRESH` for schedule-only changes and `DROP ... SYNC` + `CREATE` for structural changes (added/removed refresh, toggled APPEND).
  - `chkit pull` parses the REFRESH clause from `system.tables.create_table_query` and ignores the `DEFINER` / `SQL SECURITY` clauses that managed ClickHouse environments auto-inject.
  - Validation catches: missing/both `every`/`after`, invalid interval formats, non-APPEND RMV pointing at a replicated (`SharedMergeTree` / `Replicated*`) target (ClickHouse rejects this), and `DEPENDS ON` paired with `REFRESH AFTER`.

- cc1125e: Fix parameterized skip index type rendering. ClickHouse requires `set` indexes to have a size argument (e.g., `set(0)` for unlimited). Add optional `typeArgs` field to `SkipIndexDefinition` to support parameterized index types (`set`, `bloom_filter`, `tokenbf_v1`, `ngrambf_v1`) and parse type arguments from introspected schemas.
- f719c50: Fix workspace:\* dependencies in published packages. Restores manual workspace version resolution before publish due to a bun publish bug (oven-sh/bun#24687) where workspace:\* references are not resolved in the published tarball.

- bc0c6b1: Fix materialized view drop operations on managed ClickHouse environments (e.g. ObsessionDB) by using `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` instead of `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`. This ensures metadata removal is fully propagated before subsequent column drop operations execute, preventing "column is referenced by materialized view" errors.
- 9a54433: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md governance documents, .env.example for development setup, and update package.json metadata for all packages.
- b0f200d: Add support for per-column compression codecs.

  Declare a codec directly on a column with a structured discriminated union:

  ```ts
  import { codec, table } from "@chkit/core";

  const events = table({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "events",
    columns: [
      { name: "id", type: "UInt64" },
      { name: "ts", type: "DateTime", codec: { kind: "ZSTD", level: 3 } },
      {
        name: "delta",
        type: "Int64",
        codec: [{ kind: "Delta", size: 4 }, { kind: "ZSTD" }],
      },
      { name: "exp", type: "Float32", codec: codec.raw("SomeNewCodec(42)") },
    ],
    engine: "MergeTree()",
    primaryKey: ["id"],
    orderBy: ["id"],
  });
  ```

  Highlights:

  - `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD/MODIFY COLUMN` emit the `CODEC(...)` clause in the correct position (after `DEFAULT` and `COMMENT`, as required by ClickHouse).
  - `chkit generate` emits `MODIFY COLUMN ... REMOVE CODEC` when a codec is dropped and no other column fields change; otherwise a single `MODIFY COLUMN` replaces the codec.
  - `chkit pull` introspects `system.columns.compression_codec` and renders structured codec objects back into the schema file. Unknown codec tokens fall back to `codec.raw(...)` so new ClickHouse codecs still round-trip.
  - Canonicalization fills ClickHouse defaults (`ZSTD` → level 1, `LZ4HC` → level 9, `Delta`/`DoubleDelta`/`Gorilla` → size 1), so `{kind:'ZSTD'}` and `{kind:'ZSTD', level:1}` compare equal and the diff engine stays stable across pull → plan round-trips.
  - Validation catches codec chains with more than one general codec, chains that do not end with a general codec, or an empty chain (`codec: []`) — preprocessor alone is accepted since ClickHouse auto-appends the default general codec.
  - `parseCodec` falls back to `raw` when a known codec token has unexpected extra args (e.g. `ZSTD(3, 1)`), so future ClickHouse codec extensions round-trip cleanly through `chkit pull` instead of silently dropping arguments.

- a77c5b2: Add support for ClickHouse refreshable materialized views (RMVs), GA since ClickHouse 24.10.

  Define a refreshable MV by adding a `refresh` field to `materializedView()`:

  ```ts
  const dailyReport = materializedView({
    database: "analytics",
    name: "daily_report_mv",
    to: { database: "analytics", name: "daily_report" },
    refresh: { every: "1 DAY", offset: "2 HOUR" },
    as: "SELECT toDate(ts) AS day, count() AS total FROM analytics.events GROUP BY day",
  });
  ```

  Supported fields: `every`, `after`, `offset`, `randomize`, `dependsOn`, `settings`, `append`, `empty`.

  Highlights:

  - `chkit generate` emits `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY REFRESH` for schedule-only changes and `DROP ... SYNC` + `CREATE` for structural changes (added/removed refresh, toggled APPEND).
  - `chkit pull` parses the REFRESH clause from `system.tables.create_table_query` and ignores the `DEFINER` / `SQL SECURITY` clauses that managed ClickHouse environments auto-inject.
  - Validation catches: missing/both `every`/`after`, invalid interval formats, non-APPEND RMV pointing at a replicated (`SharedMergeTree` / `Replicated*`) target (ClickHouse rejects this), and `DEPENDS ON` paired with `REFRESH AFTER`.

  See the [Refreshable materialized views docs](https://chkit.obsessiondb.com/schema/refreshable-views/) for the full reference.

    // before
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      typeArgs: "0",
      granularity: 1,
    },
    // after
    {
      name: "idx_set",
      expression: "source",
      type: "set",
      maxRows: 0,
      granularity: 1,
    },
  ];
  ```

  | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `type: 'minmax'`                               | `type: 'minmax'`                                                                    |
  | `type: 'set', typeArgs: '0'`                   | `type: 'set', maxRows: 0`                                                           |
  | `type: 'set', typeArgs: '1000'`                | `type: 'set', maxRows: 1000`                                                        |
  | `type: 'bloom_filter'`                         | `type: 'bloom_filter'`                                                              |
  | `type: 'bloom_filter', typeArgs: '0.01'`       | `type: 'bloom_filter', falsePositiveRate: 0.01`                                     |
  | `type: 'tokenbf_v1', typeArgs: '32768, 3, 0'`  | `type: 'tokenbf_v1', sizeBytes: 32768, hashFunctions: 3, randomSeed: 0`             |
  | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', typeArgs: '3, 256, 2, 0'` | `type: 'ngrambf_v1', ngramSize: 3, sizeBytes: 256, hashFunctions: 2, randomSeed: 0` |

  Highlights:

  - `set` now requires `maxRows` at the type level — forgetting it is a TypeScript error rather than a runtime validation failure.
  - `tokenbf_v1` and `ngrambf_v1` have typed `sizeBytes`, `hashFunctions`, `randomSeed` (and `ngramSize` for ngram), so positional argument mistakes are caught at compile time.
  - `bloom_filter` keeps `falsePositiveRate` optional — omit it to emit a bare `bloom_filter` clause.
  - `chkit pull` now introspects `system.data_skipping_indices.type_full` and emits the structured fields back into schema files; unknown types still round-trip via the existing path.
  - The `index_type_missing_args` validation code is removed since it is now a compile-time concern.

- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.

## 0.1.0-beta.22

### Patch Changes

- c63c74f: Add `emitMigrations` option to the codegen plugin. When enabled, generates a self-contained TypeScript module with all migration SQL inlined and a `runMigrations()` function for environments without filesystem access (e.g., Cloudflare Workers). Also extracts `splitSqlStatements` and `extractExecutableStatements` into `@chkit/core` as shared utilities.
- ba60638: Add homepage and repository metadata to all packages, and link READMEs to the chkit CLI package and documentation site.
- c396fb5: Generated migration modules now import `extractExecutableStatements` from `@chkit/core/utils` instead of inlining the sql-splitter source. Adds a `./utils` sub-path export to `@chkit/core`.
- 1a5caa3: Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
- a94a2a1: Replace @stricli/core with a custom CLI framework, migrate plugins to declared flags, and refine the plugin API and error handling.
- a94a2a1: Fix migration ordering so tables are created before views and materialized views that depend on them.

        codec: [{ kind: "Delta", size: 4 }, { kind: "ZSTD" }],

  Highlights:

  - `set` now requires `maxRows` at the type level — forgetting it is a TypeScript error rather than a runtime validation failure.
  - `tokenbf_v1` and `ngrambf_v1` have typed `sizeBytes`, `hashFunctions`, `randomSeed` (and `ngramSize` for ngram), so positional argument mistakes are caught at compile time.
  - `bloom_filter` keeps `falsePositiveRate` optional — omit it to emit a bare `bloom_filter` clause.
  - `chkit pull` now introspects `system.data_skipping_indices.type_full` and emits the structured fields back into schema files; unknown types still round-trip via the existing path.
  - The `index_type_missing_args` validation code is removed since it is now a compile-time concern.

- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.

## 0.1.0-beta.20

### Patch Changes

- c63c74f: Add `emitMigrations` option to the codegen plugin. When enabled, generates a self-contained TypeScript module with all migration SQL inlined and a `runMigrations()` function for environments without filesystem access (e.g., Cloudflare Workers). Also extracts `splitSqlStatements` and `extractExecutableStatements` into `@chkit/core` as shared utilities.
- ba60638: Add homepage and repository metadata to all packages, and link READMEs to the chkit CLI package and documentation site.
- c396fb5: Generated migration modules now import `extractExecutableStatements` from `@chkit/core/utils` instead of inlining the sql-splitter source. Adds a `./utils` sub-path export to `@chkit/core`.
- 1a5caa3: Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
- a94a2a1: Replace @stricli/core with a custom CLI framework, migrate plugins to declared flags, and refine the plugin API and error handling.
- a94a2a1: Fix migration ordering so tables are created before views and materialized views that depend on them.
- cc1125e: Fix parameterized skip index type rendering. ClickHouse requires `set` indexes to have a size argument (e.g., `set(0)` for unlimited). Add optional `typeArgs` field to `SkipIndexDefinition` to support parameterized index types (`set`, `bloom_filter`, `tokenbf_v1`, `ngrambf_v1`) and parse type arguments from introspected schemas.
- f719c50: Fix workspace:\* dependencies in published packages. Restores manual workspace version resolution before publish due to a bun publish bug (oven-sh/bun#24687) where workspace:\* references are not resolved in the published tarball.
- a94a2a1: Move flag parsing and shared types to @chkit/core, split plugin-codegen into focused modules, and resolve lint warnings.
- bc0c6b1: Fix materialized view drop operations on managed ClickHouse environments (e.g. ObsessionDB) by using `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` instead of `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS`. This ensures metadata removal is fully propagated before subsequent column drop operations execute, preventing "column is referenced by materialized view" errors.
- 9a54433: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md governance documents, .env.example for development setup, and update package.json metadata for all packages.
- a3a09cf: Rename plugin-typegen to plugin-codegen and add ingestion functions.
- d983fdf: Rename internals and CLI binary from chkit to chkit.
- a52a2b2: Validate that `set`, `tokenbf_v1`, and `ngrambf_v1` skip index types require `typeArgs` (ClickHouse 26+ compliance). Type-level validation enforces this at compile time; runtime validation provides a safety net.
