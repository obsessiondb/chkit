# @chkit/plugin-obsessiondb

## 0.1.0

### Patch Changes

- a94a2a1: Add @chkit/plugin-obsessiondb for ObsessionDB engine compatibility.
- f4ff75d: Add `chkit query "<sql>"` command that runs an ad-hoc SQL query against the configured target (default ClickHouse, or the active plugin executor). When the ObsessionDB plugin is loaded, all ClickHouse-bound commands (`generate`, `migrate`, `status`, `drift`, `check`, `query`) accept `--service <name>` to override the selected service by name for that single invocation.
- bb62cd0: Backfill `plan`/`run`/`resume` now refuse to run against ObsessionDB instead of silently opening a direct ClickHouse connection. When a service is selected, these commands will eventually submit jobs to the ObsessionDB backend; until that lands they error with a clear message pointing to `--local` for direct execution.
- bb62cd0: Print the "Next steps" block once and with the correct runner for the selected package manager. `create-chkit` previously printed it twice — once package-manager-aware and once from onboarding with a hardcoded `bunx` — so `--package-manager npm` users were told to run `bunx chkit …`. Onboarding now derives the runner (`npx` / `pnpm dlx` / `yarn dlx` / `bunx`) from the package manager, and `create-chkit` only prints its own next-steps when onboarding is skipped, removing the duplicate.
- d9d5038: Polish error messages and a few noisy outputs:

  - A table defined with `orderBy` but no `primaryKey` no longer crashes with a raw `TypeError`; the primary key defaults to the order-by columns, matching ClickHouse.
  - Built-in command errors (e.g. a rejected migration) surface their own clean message instead of being wrapped in `Plugin "core" failed in ...`.
  - `chkit query` syntax errors no longer leak the injected `FORMAT JSON` clause the user never typed, and the "Expected one of" token dump is capped.
  - Connection errors whose reason is only in the message (no `.code`) — e.g. a typo'd host — are now recognized and cleaned instead of leaking the raw client string.
  - The post-apply message names the resolved journal table (respecting `CHKIT_JOURNAL_TABLE`) instead of a hardcoded `_chkit_migrations`.
  - The ObsessionDB "authenticated but no service selected" reminder is suppressed when a direct `clickhouse` target is configured (it was layered in from a global login, not chosen for the project).

- ca968d9: Fix stale internal dependency pins in published packages. `chkit` shipped with `@chkit/plugin-obsessiondb` pinned one version behind because the publish step only resolved `workspace:` specifiers in `dependencies`/`devDependencies`, skipping `optionalDependencies` (where the plugin is declared) — so the CLI bundled an outdated plugin and every `chkit query` failed with `serviceSlug is required`.

  The publish resolver now covers every dependency field, `@chkit/codegen` uses `workspace:*` for `@chkit/core` instead of an exact pin, and two release guards (source-side `check:workspace-deps` and packed-tarball `check:packed-deps`) fail the build if any publishable package would ship a stale or unresolved internal dependency.

- f1066a6: Add device-code authentication (login/logout/whoami) and remote backfill routing via ObsessionDB backend.
- bb62cd0: Register the `--local` and `--service` overrides against the correct command keys. The command registry keys plugin flag extensions by top-level command name, so the previous two-word targets (e.g. `backfill run`) never matched — `chkit backfill plan/run/resume --local` was rejected as an unknown flag, making the local-execution escape hatch unreachable. `--service` was also never extended to `pull`, so `chkit pull schema --service <name>` failed. Both flags now parse and route correctly.
- 0016a11: Emit a structured `--json` envelope from the non-interactive ObsessionDB auth flow so programmatic callers can chain steps without parsing prose. `signup` and `service claim` now honor `--json`: each terminal/pause state prints a single `{ command, schemaVersion, status, next }` object instead of human runbook text, where `next` carries the exact command to run (e.g. `{ "status": "otp_sent", "email": "me@x.com", "next": { "needs": "code", "command": "chkit obsessiondb signup --email me@x.com --code <CODE>" } }`). Statuses cover `no_email → otp_sent → verified` (signup) and `claimed` / `provisioning` / `already_claimed` (claim); failures emit the `ok:false` error envelope. Text-mode output is unchanged, and the runbook command strings are now the single source shared by both prose and JSON so they cannot drift.
- bb62cd0: Make `--json` always emit a JSON object, never a bare JSON-encoded string. `printOutput` now wraps any plain string printed under `--json` in `{ schemaVersion, message }`, closing the whole class of bug at the serializer so no command can leak a bare string. `chkit obsessiondb whoami` gains a structured envelope (`status: logged_in | not_logged_in | session_expired`), and `chkit obsessiondb service list` emits a single object with a `services[]` array instead of one JSON line per service (which was not valid single-JSON). Previously these commands `JSON.stringify`'d a prose string (e.g. `"Not logged in…"`), breaking any pipe to `jq`. Text-mode output is unchanged. Note: this changes the `--json` output shape of `whoami` and `service list` from a string to an object.
- bb62cd0: `chkit obsessiondb logout` now reports "No active session." when there are no stored credentials, instead of always printing "Logged out." (which implied it had ended a session that never existed). Logout stays idempotent and exits 0 either way; only the message changes.
- 99136de: Add ObsessionDB onboarding to `chkit init` and `create-chkit`: a 3-way "how do you want to connect?" prompt covering an existing ClickHouse instance, an existing ObsessionDB account, and claiming a free ObsessionDB dev instance. Adds passwordless CLI signup (`chkit obsessiondb signup`, email + one-time code) with automatic personal-org creation, and `chkit obsessiondb service claim` to claim and provision a free instance, then write a ready-to-use connection.

  Non-interactive callers (agents/CI) now get a full runbook instead of dead-end prompts: when no TTY is detected, onboarding prints every connect path as runnable commands, and `signup` supports a two-step OTP flow — `--request-only` sends the code and prints the exact follow-up command, then `--email --code <CODE>` verifies without re-sending (which would otherwise invalidate the code). When an explicit connect path is requested but cannot complete (e.g. `--connect claim` with no email, or a bad code), `chkit init` and `create-chkit` now exit non-zero instead of falling through to "next steps" with a success status, so scripts can detect the failure.

- c8af201: Add query routing through ObsessionDB: core commands (migrate, status, drift, check) use a plugin-provided ClickHouse executor when authenticated with a selected service. Adds `getContext` plugin hook, per-project service binding during login, `select-service` command, and remote executor that proxies queries through the ObsessionDB API.
- 0011d85: Add ObsessionDB service aliases for `--service`. Users can manage aliases with `chkit obsessiondb service alias set|list|remove`, and `--service` now resolves exact service names before falling back to saved aliases.
- 75bf348: Fix broken ObsessionDB integration after the platform moved service-scoped RPC endpoints from `serviceId` to `serviceSlug`. The plugin now sources and stores the service slug instead of the id and sends `serviceSlug` to `workbench.query.execute`, `jobs.list`/`submit`, and `services.get`. This repairs `migrate`, `generate`, `status`, `drift`, `check`, `query`, and remote backfill against ObsessionDB targets. The bundled oRPC contract copies were also refreshed to match the current platform schemas (services now expose `slug`, query results are array-of-arrays, job details carry per-task runs).

  Notes:

  - The selected-service file (`obsessiondb.json`) now stores `service_slug` instead of `service_id`. Existing selections will need to be re-run with `chkit obsessiondb service select` (and any aliases re-set).
  - The remote backfill flag `--service-id` is renamed to `--service-slug`.

- a52a2b2: Strip `storage_policy` setting from tables during local migrations (for non-ObsessionDB targets). Improves local development experience by removing cloud-only settings automatically.
- bb62cd0: Send a versioned `User-Agent: chkit/<version>` to the ObsessionDB API (oRPC query client and auth client) instead of a flat `chkit-cli`. This matches the direct-ClickHouse executor's identity and lets the API forward the header so CLI traffic is attributable in `system.query_log.http_user_agent`.
- 5856d48: Add user-profile config fallback so `chkit query` works from any directory without a local `clickhouse.config.ts`. When no project config is found in the current directory, chkit now looks for `~/.config/chkit/config.ts` (honoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). If ObsessionDB credentials exist (`~/.config/chkit/credentials.json`), chkit synthesizes a minimal query-only config and loads the ObsessionDB plugin through an optional runtime import. ObsessionDB bootstrap commands such as `chkit obsessiondb login` can also run before credentials exist. Project-only commands (`generate`, `migrate`, `status`, `drift`, `check`, `codegen`, `pull`) still require a project config. The ObsessionDB plugin now persists the selected service to `~/.config/chkit/obsessiondb.json` when running in profile mode, and query errors now point users to `login`, `service select`, or `--service` as appropriate.
- 713176e: Sanitize the auto-derived default org name during ObsessionDB signup. The personal org name is now stripped of the email `+subaddress` (e.g. `marc+clisignup@…` → `marc`) and any non-display characters, falling back to `playground` when nothing usable remains. The `--org-name` override still wins.
- 45ff0fe: Add `user = currentUser()` filter to all system.processes and system.query_log queries to satisfy ClickHouse row-level security policies.
- dfaa8fa: Consolidate all publishable packages on Zod 4. `@chkit/plugin-obsessiondb` was pinned to `zod@3.25.76` while the rest of the toolkit used Zod 4, pulling two major versions into the dependency tree; it now uses `zod@^4.3.6`. Its oRPC contracts are unaffected — `@orpc/contract` validates through the Standard Schema interface, which both Zod majors implement. `@chkit/plugin-codegen` now declares `zod` as a peer dependency (`^4.0.0`) instead of a direct dependency, so generated Zod schemas resolve against the consumer's own `zod` install rather than a bundled copy.

## 0.1.0-beta.26

### Patch Changes

- a94a2a1: Add @chkit/plugin-obsessiondb for ObsessionDB engine compatibility.
- f4ff75d: Add `chkit query "<sql>"` command that runs an ad-hoc SQL query against the configured target (default ClickHouse, or the active plugin executor). When the ObsessionDB plugin is loaded, all ClickHouse-bound commands (`generate`, `migrate`, `status`, `drift`, `check`, `query`) accept `--service <name>` to override the selected service by name for that single invocation.
- f1066a6: Add device-code authentication (login/logout/whoami) and remote backfill routing via ObsessionDB backend.
- c8af201: Add query routing through ObsessionDB: core commands (migrate, status, drift, check) use a plugin-provided ClickHouse executor when authenticated with a selected service. Adds `getContext` plugin hook, per-project service binding during login, `select-service` command, and remote executor that proxies queries through the ObsessionDB API.
- 0011d85: Add ObsessionDB service aliases for `--service`. Users can manage aliases with `chkit obsessiondb service alias set|list|remove`, and `--service` now resolves exact service names before falling back to saved aliases.
- a52a2b2: Strip `storage_policy` setting from tables during local migrations (for non-ObsessionDB targets). Improves local development experience by removing cloud-only settings automatically.
- 5856d48: Add user-profile config fallback so `chkit query` works from any directory without a local `clickhouse.config.ts`. When no project config is found in the current directory, chkit now looks for `~/.config/chkit/config.ts` (honoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). If ObsessionDB credentials exist (`~/.config/chkit/credentials.json`), chkit synthesizes a minimal query-only config and loads the ObsessionDB plugin through an optional runtime import. ObsessionDB bootstrap commands such as `chkit obsessiondb login` can also run before credentials exist. Project-only commands (`generate`, `migrate`, `status`, `drift`, `check`, `codegen`, `pull`) still require a project config. The ObsessionDB plugin now persists the selected service to `~/.config/chkit/obsessiondb.json` when running in profile mode, and query errors now point users to `login`, `service select`, or `--service` as appropriate.
- 45ff0fe: Add `user = currentUser()` filter to all system.processes and system.query_log queries to satisfy ClickHouse row-level security policies.
