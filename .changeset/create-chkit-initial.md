Add the `create-chkit` package, a scaffolder that downloads a curated example from the chkit repository (default: `clickbench`) into a new project directory, rewrites `chkit` and `@chkit/*` dependency versions to `latest`, and runs install with the detected package manager. Restructure the Getting Started docs into two pages — "Start with an example" (using `create-chkit`) and "Add to an existing project" (using `chkit init`) — and update the docs URL printed by `chkit init` to point to the new page.
