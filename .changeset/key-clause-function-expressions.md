Support ClickHouse function expressions in `primaryKey`/`orderBy` (e.g. `toDate(ts)`, `toStartOfHour(session_end)`). Validation no longer reports `primary_key_missing_column`/`order_by_missing_column` for expression entries, and generated DDL emits them verbatim instead of quoting the whole expression as a column name. Plain column references are still validated and backtick-quoted as before.
