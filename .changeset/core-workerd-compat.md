Move `loadSchemaDefinitions` out of the `@chkit/core` barrel export into a dedicated `@chkit/core/schema-loader` subpath. This removes the transitive `fast-glob` -> `node:os` dependency from the main entry point, making `@chkit/core` safe to import in non-Node runtimes like Cloudflare Workers (workerd). The `./utils` subpath is removed since `extractExecutableStatements` is now available directly from `@chkit/core`.
