Make backfill time column configurable with smart auto-detection. Replace hardcoded `event_time` column with support for `--time-column` CLI flag, `defaults.timeColumn` config option, and interactive detection that scans schema definitions for DateTime columns in ORDER BY or by common naming conventions.
